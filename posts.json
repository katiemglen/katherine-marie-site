Angela, our host and my family friend, had made wonderful biscuits and gravy for breakfast while her daughter Abby and I caught up with each other.&nbsp; Chad spent the morning working, devouring food and mapping out the next destination points.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_103\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"542\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-103 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161219_124703.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_124703\" width=\"542\" height=\"305\"> Abby, Angela and me right after a delicious breakfast[/caption]\n\nAfter Chad was apparently \u201cdragged\u201d to Colorado with my request to see my friends, he quickly took an interest in the nearby mountains and ski resorts.&nbsp; He immediately called his ski patrol friends back home at Hyland Hills Ski Area, Bloomington and gathered suggestions for locations to spend a day skiing/snowboarding on a mountain.&nbsp; In my mind all I was thinking about was the location of my insurance card and where the nearest hospital is for when something crazy happens while skiing on a real mountain.&nbsp; This would be our first time skiing/snowboarding on a mountain as we are both are accustomed to the \u201cmountains\u201d Minnesota has to offer at our ski hills.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-136\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161219_145937.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_145937\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">\n\nBut first, the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs.&nbsp; Saying thank you and goodbye to our Colorado friends, we packed the car.&nbsp; Once on the road, Chad was instantly ready to camp in the car and was looking forward to sleeping in the evening.&nbsp; I find this funny because with his current choice of Patagonia attire and facial hair, he totally fits the part of a wanderer and the temperament of all of the tree-huggers in the area.&nbsp; My attire consists of Patagonia and athletic gear to wick away moisture and hold off the body odor as long as possible.&nbsp; Showers are truly amazing and cherished\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-141 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161219_1506471.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_150647\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\">.\n\nThe Garden of the Gods was quiet with little tourist traffic.&nbsp; I was oh so lucky to drive through the park, a privilege apparently, since I am notorious for killing the manual car.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-131 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161219_150652.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_150652\" width=\"621\" height=\"350\">\nChad has now started a tally of how many times I will kill that car on this trip.&nbsp; So far I am up to 11 times\u2026.but to be fair, I have not had much practice and have recently upgraded to the highway and handling inner city traffic.\n<h3>Garden of the Gods Highlights:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Hardly any people because of cold temperatures (40 degrees)</li>\n \t<li>Seeing the sun was wonderful</li>\n \t<li>Cowgirl boots don\u2019t have traction and make for a hilarious site while walking on snow and rocks</li>\n \t<li>Chad doesn\u2019t appreciate tourist photos as much as the other tourists around him</li>\n \t<li>Chad also noticed a lot of people chilling in their cars on the top of large hill (marijuana dude)</li>\n \t<li>Climbing the rocks was a true challenge</li>\n</ul>\n[gallery ids=\"140,134,132,110\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nArapahoe Basin Ski Resort was next on the list, but we would be skiing in the morning with the plan to sleep in the resort\u2019s parking lot.&nbsp; It was near dark when we started our 3-hour drive into the mountains and I was thankful Chad was driving for this part of the journey.&nbsp; He loves adrenaline and I enjoy adrenaline spurts, making the curvy mountain roads with tight corners fun for him and nerve-racking for me.&nbsp; We missed most of the beauty as we focused on the icy roads and avoided looking down the deep caverns that hosted small twinkling lights of homes far below.&nbsp; I loved all of the encouraging signs on the side of the road that cheered us along while we skidded around corners: Avalanche Area, Falling Rocks, Icy Before Bridges, 20 MPH Corner and my favorite Avalanche Blasting Area.\n\n[gallery ids=\"133,109\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nI have never been so thrilled to sleep in a stationary car after driving what felt like +12 hours through the mountain slopes.&nbsp; When we could see the mountains during the day we were both astounded by the sheer size and texture that cannot be captured to their fullest by camera.&nbsp; According to Chad, if we had purchased a really nice \u201ctechnical\u201d spotting scope all of our sight-seeing problems would be cured.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_119\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-119\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161219_153050.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_153050\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> We aren't smiling for the picture, we are laughing because I just scraped Chad's really nice sunglasses on the rock above me. &nbsp;Chad is laughing off the pain.[/caption]\n\n[gallery ids=\"134,108,104\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-105\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161219_145852.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_145852\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-107\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161219_145244.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_145244\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-175 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161219_150101.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_150101\" width=\"442\" height=\"249\"><img class=\"  wp-image-174 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161219_145400.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_145400\" width=\"444\" height=\"250\">Onto the next adventure!",

    "content": "<h2>Day 5 Location: Grand Junction, CO and all of Utah</h2>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-177\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161221_072809.jpg\" alt=\"20161221_072809\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">Waking up in Grand Junction, CO we were surprised that there was still a tiny bit of frost on the windows of the car.&nbsp; To no avail, we cannot escape the cold weather yet but it has helped us sleep peacefully knowing others cannot peak into our windows.&nbsp; Skipping breakfast, we hit the road heading to Utah with the goal of getting to Las Vegas that evening.\n\n[gallery ids=\"178,179,180\" type=\"rectangular\" orderby=\"rand\"]\n\nCrossing the Utah border before the sun peaked over the mountains, we stopped at the first rest stop to survey the area.&nbsp; The terrain looks like the terrain from the cowboy movies, what you picture horseback riding to look like in the west and settings for old western towns.&nbsp; The landscape was so different that Colorado and the ground was instantly dry, sandy and hardly holds vegetation.\n\n[gallery ids=\"205\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-209 alignleft\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161221_075249.jpg\" alt=\"20161221_075249\" width=\"384\" height=\"217\">\n\nYes, personal hygiene is important and you can see Chad brushing his teeth as the sun peaks over the distant mountains from Colorado.&nbsp; Chad keeps reminding me that snakes are everywhere, especially in the west.\n\nCan you tell he is not a big fan of snakes?&nbsp; We did see a rabbit but other than that, no wildlife to be seen.&nbsp; If we had a spotting scope, we could see for miles.&nbsp; Chad is still pretty salty about not having this device.\n\n[gallery ids=\"207,208,211\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nThis day was filled with traveling through rock formations that have been sliced to allow a highway to pass through them and viewing the endless terrain that seems inhabitable from my perspective.&nbsp; Why would anyone want to live in Utah?&nbsp; We never saw any houses or small towns until we were more than half way across the state.&nbsp; Even then the towns were small, sketchy and were places we didn\u2019t want to stay long.&nbsp; Whoever owned the gas stations out here were for sure making a ton of money because their stops would be the only ones for hundreds of miles.\n\n[gallery ids=\"212,213,214\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nWe stopped occasionally at rest stops to get out and explore the terrain.&nbsp; In one particular location we stopped right before a large range of rock.&nbsp; We later found out it used to be a reef back when there was a large lake covering the west half of the U.S. millions of years ago.&nbsp; We wondered around and I was able to spot fossils everywhere of where used to be coral, cracked mud and a few rocks that had the ribs of fish imprinted on them.\n\n[gallery ids=\"215,216,217,218\" type=\"rectangular\" orderby=\"rand\"]\n\nWe used this time to stretch our legs, wander and hike on our own.&nbsp; There is never alone time when traveling in a car or sleeping in the same area and it was nice to have the peace.&nbsp; We met each other on a rock ledge where I found a rock shaped like a heart.&nbsp; I gave this to Chad and laughed.&nbsp; He frowned, looked around and presented me with a rock that looked like a slice of pie.&nbsp; Apparently Chad has given me a symbol of his stomach and we laughed, chucking the rocks down the steep hill we rested on.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-219 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161221_095351.jpg\" alt=\"20161221_095351\" width=\"469\" height=\"264\">\n\nHours later, we started to see more small towns proving that people do actually live in Utah.&nbsp; The west side of the state was heavily populated with small (I mean super small) towns dotted along the highway.&nbsp; We headed south toward Zion Nation Park and meant to catch a glimpse of the rock formations before the sun went down.\n\n[gallery ids=\"224,223,222\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nChad finally killed the car inside the national park and I sure made a big deal about it.&nbsp; Jimmy Johns also makes for great comfort food for Chad.&nbsp; We went for a hike at the very top of a large rock formation that over looked a part of the large red mountain range to the east.&nbsp; The trail was only a mile long to the point but we had chosen the wrong kinds of shoes to climb the mudding red hiking trail.&nbsp; I in the cowgirl boots and Chad is his worn hiking boots had as much traction as a slippery seal.&nbsp; Let\u2019s not fall off the rocky hill, ok?\n\n[gallery ids=\"225,226,231\" type=\"rectangular\" orderby=\"rand\"]\n\nThe sun went down quickly and we departed to St. George for dinner.&nbsp; We found a more authentic restaurant and ate the first real large meal of the day.&nbsp; Did you know that Utah doesn\u2019t allow drinks to be made in front of the guests and they need to be prepared in a back room out of sight?&nbsp; They also have to get special licenses for dancing at large gatherings (depending on the location).&nbsp; Does Footloose ring a bell?&nbsp; Our waiter laughed and told us that not that far away was the town where that story came from.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-227\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161221_144401.jpg\" alt=\"20161221_144401\" width=\"8384\" height=\"1680\">\n\n[gallery ids=\"230,229,228\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nNeeding some Wi-Fi, we made our way to a caf\u00e9 and I set to work on blogs and Chad to research hotels in Las Vegas.&nbsp; We never planned to hit this city but we found ourselves only a few hours away.&nbsp; Might as well stay in a hotel, see the strip and head out to the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; We made it down into the valley that houses Las Vegas and I made a sarcastic comment about the Trump Tower to our left as we coasted in.&nbsp; Come to find out, our Treasure Island room over looks where we have come in as well as a direct view of the Trump Tower.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_233\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-233\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161221_220111.jpg\" alt=\"20161221_220111\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> Trump Tower[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_232\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161221_220103.jpg\" alt=\"20161221_220103\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> Frist view of the city as we drove in[/caption]\n\nThe city was alive and buzzing but we were tired.&nbsp; A shower and an actual bed was a warm welcome at the end of the day.",

I was driving and Chad was dozing off and on. A few times I pushed his head back against the seat as he was slumped forward resting.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-340 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161223_162524.jpg\" alt=\"20161223_162524\" width=\"392\" height=\"220\">Chad woke right before a sign that read \u201cVisitors Information\u201d and we both agreed to stop.&nbsp; I had pulled off and hung a left down a road towards what I thought was the visitors center.&nbsp; Miles later, we realized that this wasn\u2019t right.&nbsp; Cresting a hill, we entered the Town of Chloride and instantly regretted this decision.&nbsp; There was junk strewn all around on both sides of the street and the road led us to what seemed to be the only intersection in town.&nbsp; A sketchy bar, the sketchiest bar I have ever seen, on the corner read \u201ctourist information\u201d in hand painted letters.&nbsp; Metal cans, barbed wire, and chunks of god-knows-what were strewed across the yard of house directly across from the bar.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-345 alignleft\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161223_155328.jpg\" alt=\"20161223_155328\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\">I recognized an old white 4-legged washer sitting on the ground surrounded by miss-placed artifacts.&nbsp; Never mind grass, the owner of the labeled \u201cOld Red House\u201d didn\u2019t or had not seemed to care about disposing of any of their trash that laid in the yard.&nbsp; Chad later found out that the town Chloride was a ghost town and was kept up by only a hand full of people.&nbsp; So much for helpful information about the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; I high-tailed it out of there with also another tally added to my engine kills.\n\nThe rain was coming down gently and we made it into Flagstaff, Arizona around dark.&nbsp; Tired and hungry, I was no good at direction and we made a few U-turns on our way to dinner.&nbsp; We ate delicious Thai curry and a noodle dish.&nbsp; It was Christmas eve and there were hardly any people out but this was also due to a \u201cterrible\u201d storm that was about to hit.&nbsp; The waiter said this storm would be one of the worst they have seen in a while.&nbsp; Chad was really itching to use his snow tires and we both weren\u2019t worried by the news.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_317\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-317\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161223_200605.jpg\" alt=\"20161223_200605\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> Note in the upper left corner the small spoon of thai peppers[/caption]\n\nAfter dinner, we hit a movie.&nbsp; Wow, that\u2019s clich\u00e9.&nbsp; We waited for over an hour in the movie theater until our showing of The Assassins Creed.&nbsp; We stalled by hitting the arcade and only then regretted not gambling a little so that we could have some extra spending cash to put into the Jurassic Park game.&nbsp; &nbsp;By the time we were at our car again, the show had fallen heavily and it was deep.&nbsp; We made camp in a nearby Holiday Inn and Christmas story jokes were made about \u201cnot having room at the Inn\u201d.&nbsp; The snow layer made nice camouflage and we slept soundly unnoticed.&nbsp; Happy Christmas Eve.&nbsp; This was the most uneventful day we have had so far and it didn\u2019t feel as if we were on vacation.\n\n&nbsp;",

We walked downtown and peaked into a camping store, an overly priced rock shop and lastly an exclusive Patagonia retail outlet.&nbsp; Practically representatives of the brand, we strode in to check out the articles of clothing not available at other retailers.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-318\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161224_103517.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_103517\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">Dressed head to toe in Patagonia, we jived with the cashiers and I tried to find some hiking pants.&nbsp; American thighs and a tiny waist are not what Patagonia tailors to and I was out of luck.&nbsp; Oh well. Chad meanwhile had been keeping to himself and had a troubled look on his face the entire time.&nbsp; Come to find out, he needed to find a restroom and violently relieve himself.&nbsp; Prik Nam Pla traditional Thai spice (diced Thai peppers in fish sauce) from the night before was the culprit and I was glad I had only had a taste whereas Chad had multiple scoops added to his meal.&nbsp; I guess his tolerance for spicy had been lost on this trip of anything but spicy food.

The snow was coming down and people on the side of the road took advantage of the picturesque landscape.&nbsp; Chad mentioned that he was looking forward to using his Canada rated snow tires and we raced around slow, newly snow experienced drivers.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-375 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161224_160647.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_160647\" width=\"498\" height=\"280\">\n\nWe reached the Grand Canyon a few hours later after dodging and weaving sight-seers.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the giant snow storm coming in hindered any view of the canyon and the rangers had said that this storm was one of the larger storms they have had in a long time.&nbsp; They urged travelers to leave as soon as possible.&nbsp; Chad and I jogged along the rim, not being able to see or do anything else while we were there.&nbsp; We were able to have our picture snapped from another tourist as I made jokes about the beautiful vast canyons behind us.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_368\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"9072\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-368\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161224_153959.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_153959\" width=\"9072\" height=\"1776\"> Our view of the Grand Canyon[/caption]\n\nAdrenaline junky Chad raced out of the park going the speed limit as everyone around us was only going around 15 mph.&nbsp; He bobbed and weaved again around cars until we made it to a divide between two major highways.&nbsp; We chose highway 180 due to the lack of cars taking this road and we spun down the freeway in what seemed like average Minnesota weather.&nbsp; To everyone traveling, this was an absolute blizzard.&nbsp; We spun down the road ducking around cars with ease.&nbsp; Bless you Canada rated snow tires.&nbsp; Chad challenged himself as he stooped into the shoulder multiple times to let a plow pass or to dodge around a flailing cars.\n\n[gallery ids=\"377,378\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nWe came upon what looked like a major accident on a rising hill with over 10 cars stopped.&nbsp; After asking the parked car in front of us, we discovered that no one could climb the hill because it was too slippery.&nbsp; Chad hunkered down and slowly made his way passed every single car.&nbsp; I could feel glares and hear the voices inside my head from others cursing us as we passed so easily.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-380 alignleft\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161224_161213.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_161213\" width=\"236\" height=\"420\">We stopped almost halfway up the hill to help a car that had slipped to the right side of the road.&nbsp; Chad attached a tow rope as I reversed the car down the slipper slope to meet his other hook.&nbsp; I instructed the driver of the stuck car on how to maneuver when getting out of snow while being pulled and Chad took his place the Diesel Jetta.&nbsp; Language barriers and unfamiliar to the snowy conditions, the Indian family shook with cold and worry.&nbsp; I heard a baby crying from the back seat as the car lurched free and drove slowly to the left side of the road.\n\nWe helped as much as we could but the whole lot behind us were trapped as they couldn\u2019t climb the slop.&nbsp; They would have to wait for the nearest plow to come, which shouldn\u2019t be too long.&nbsp; Chad resumed climbing the hill and the many more after this.&nbsp; By the end of the trip back to Flagstaff, Chad had successfully shaved off 30 minutes in a snow storm from our travel time that brought us to the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; I was just happy to be alive, warm and well.&nbsp; Serious, these tires are awesome and we didn\u2019t slip once on our 2.5-hour drive.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-369 alignleft\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161224_160612.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_160612\" width=\"388\" height=\"218\">Hardly passed 7pm, Chad and I grabbed Subway for dinner and headed to the movie theater again to watch the new Starwars movie as if the snow storm travel never happened.&nbsp; I was full instantly and saved the sandwich for later while Chad killed it on the Ruben.&nbsp; Come to find out the next morning, if we had gone on the other highway while returning from the Grand Canyon, we would have been stranded as they had closed it due to extremely poor conditions.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-385 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161224_161223.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_161223\" width=\"484\" height=\"272\"><img class=\"  wp-image-386 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161224_161257.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_161257\" width=\"486\" height=\"272\">Holiday Inn housed us again that night and it was Christmas Eve.&nbsp; Hunkered down in our sleeping arrangements, we were again shielded by the falling snow.",

The occupant(s) would then stretch out and sleep with their gear surrounded by blankets/pillows</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\nLater, we found a coffee shop to leech onto their Wi-Fi.\u00a0 A morning of blogging lead to almost a half day of blogging.\u00a0 Everyone and their mother was at the Sedona Starbucks which I assumed was the source of the slow internet\u00a0 Hey-o, dial up ring a bell?\u00a0 Chad and I spent 4 hours struggling with the cursed internet and we finally gave up and tethered his phone to my laptop to use his 4G.\u00a0 We could have had everything we needed to do done in 30 minutes with the speed of the new internet.\u00a0 We were so discouraged by the wasted time, we left to go find food for comfort.\n\nAccording to David from the rock shop, a restaurant called Nick\u2019s had the best corn beef hash he has ever eaten.\u00a0 Chad jumped on this suggestion and we ate it.\u00a0 I do agree with David, it was a pretty good corn beef hash accompanied by homemade hash browns.\n<h3>A car problem</h3>\nOn Christmas Eve we had plowed through a snow storm to get back to Flagstaff, Arizona and Chad treated this drive like an off-road snow race.\u00a0 This is also where he concluded that he burnt out his left head light as they were \u201cworking extra hard\u201d while snow surfing the terrible roads.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-474 alignleft\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161226_1519371.jpg\" alt=\"20161226_151937\" width=\"360\" height=\"202\" />So, in Sedona we searched for an auto shop.\u00a0 Two heads bent over the engine messing with the bulb didn\u2019t seem to help so Chad took over.\u00a0 Apparently, the previous owner of the car had replaced the entire light fixture and put it back in backwards.\u00a0 Chad couldn\u2019t figure out how to extract the bulb and resorted to how-to YouTube videos which helped to realize the backwards structure.\u00a0 Bulb bought and replaced, Chad displayed a hearty egotistical demeanor for what seemed like forever.\u00a0 All in good fun of course and we both mocked each other.\u00a0 Congrats Chad, you changed a bulb haha.\n<h3>Going to the Chapel</h3>\nWith reluctance, I was able to steer Chad towards the Chapel we had skipped the day before.\u00a0 There was even more people there today than the day before and Chad groaned the entire time while looking for a parking spot.\u00a0 His sarcasm and humor is a wonderful addition to anything we attempt and I appreciate the commentary.\u00a0 The chapel was small and unique as it sat on top of a rock structure.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-456 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161226_160643.jpg\" alt=\"20161226_160643\" width=\"461\" height=\"259\" />\n\nThere were tons of people weaving in and out of the chapel, but we noticed that no one stayed longer than 5 minutes.\u00a0 Obviously no one is really enjoying the result of their labors as it took over 10 minutes to park and another 10 to climb up the steep hill.\u00a0 Why only spend a short amount of time at your destination when you put so much time into it?\n<h3>Shrimp for dinner</h3>\n<img class=\"  wp-image-463 alignleft\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161226_195815.jpg\" alt=\"20161226_195815\" width=\"247\" height=\"442\" />Chad and I were tired of going out to eat and our wallets didn\u2019t appreciate the excessive use in Sedona.\u00a0 We walked around downtown, ate a small portion of fudge and walked into other spiritual stores on the strip.\u00a0 Hunger set in and we settled for a grocery store with the intention to find something simple and easy, like vegetables.\u00a0 Instead, we walked out with a bill that would have been the same as going out to eat and a bag of frozen cooked shrimp, 2 cucumbers, cocktail sauce and 2 one-gallon water jugs.\u00a0 So much for not exercising our wallets.\n\nChad used the time in the grocery store to call his family members and I used the car ride sleeping parking lot to catch up with my family.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the shrimp was defrosting on the heated leather seats of the car under my bottom.\u00a0 How else are they going to thaw?\u00a0 The heated body parts of the lower back, thighs and buttocks took shifts to prepare a thawed dinner.\nDinner was served back at our newly discovered campsite while we listened to our audio book, Outlander.\u00a0 The rest of the evening was held in suspense because of the storyline and we stayed up late listening to the story unfold.\u00a0 Who needs TV?",

    "content": "How does one stay clean when road tripping in a car across the country?\u00a0 Described below are measures I have taken to keep personal hygiene at the top of my daily list.\u00a0 Check out the practices below to see if you would consider them on your next trip.\n<h3>Always brush your teeth, especially at night</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Brushing your teeth allows the\u00a0person you are traveling with to tolerate speaking with you when you have fresh breath.</li>\n \t<li>Bring a regular, non-electric tooth brush and have a water bottle on hand for rinsing.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"  wp-image-699 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teeth.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"teeth\" width=\"390\" height=\"195\" />\n<h3>Bring unlimited wet wipes</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Grab a few wipes to take into a restroom. \u00a0These will be used to clean easily soiled areas on your body. Main areas include: Face, armpits, and groin.</li>\n \t<li>Wipes help clean up spills easily.</li>\n \t<li>In warm weather, they can be used to cool your face.</li>\n \t<li>Prevent acne or sores from appearing by keeping skin clean.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Consider your clothing</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>You won\u2019t need as many clothes as you think. With the right gear, clothing can be worn for multiple days and rotated between a few outfits.\n<ul>\n \t<li>I learned this the hard way as I packed a whole duffle bag full of clothes that I never wore and then had to drag everywhere.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Wear clothing material that is breathable, doesn\u2019t hold moisture and repels body odor.</li>\n \t<li>Cotton may be your go to, but the fabric takes forever to dry and easily traps body stench.</li>\n \t<li>Switch out underwear, preferably daily.</li>\n \t<li><img class=\"  wp-image-713 alignright\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/water.jpg\" alt=\"water\" width=\"141\" height=\"210\" />Suggested fabrics: Polyester, Marino Wool, Spandex, Nylon</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stay hydrated</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Even if you are sitting in a car all day, your body still needs plenty of water. Water can help you to keep alert, think clearly, tame the smell of your urine and keep skin clear.</li>\n \t<li>Read more about how <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><a href=\"https://breakingmuscle.com/learn/10-life-changing-reasons-to-drink-more-water\">drinking water is good for you</a>.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Wash your face</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Every chance you get, wash your face. While stopping for gas, food or sight-seeing enjoy a cool splash of water to remove oils and sweat from the day\u2019s travel.</li>\n \t<li>Make sure there are paper towels before you splash yourself! Don\u2019t want to look like a wet dog retreating out the of bathroom, do you?</li>\n</ul>\n[caption id=\"attachment_704\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"463\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-704 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wash-face.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"wash-face\" width=\"463\" height=\"309\" /> Please be as dramatic as he is while washing your face[/caption]\n<h3>Abundant deodorant</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Keep your pits smelling fresh with your deodorant stick.</li>\n \t<li>****For those of you who like to shave your armpits, caution is advised. Make sure you have a fresh razor to prevent having an outbreak of irritated skin.\u00a0 Once shaved or irritated, wait for your newly cut pores to heal before applying deodorant.\n<ul>\n \t<li>If you are hardcore about the trip or it\u2019s No Shave November leading into winter months, my best suggestion is skipping shaving completely. Unless you are planning to show your armpits to anyone, it really doesn\u2019t matter if they are shaved or not.</li>\n \t<li>It all comes down to personal preference on shaving, but no one likes sore or irritated skin. Avoid the razor, avoid the irritation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Daily wipe off the deodorant and reapply. If you would have taken a shower, this step would have already been completed.\u00a0 Since there is no shower, you need to do it yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n[caption id=\"attachment_703\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"357\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-703 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/deoderant.png\" alt=\"deoderant\" width=\"357\" height=\"204\" /> Uh oh, he didn't prepare himself with deoderant[/caption]\n<h3>Bush or comb your hair</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>You don\u2019t have to look like a traveling hippie if you don\u2019t want to. Bush your mane at least once a day to take care of it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Laundry</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>If you have patience or down-time, visiting a coin laundromat is A-Ok.</li>\n \t<li>When rooming in a hotel, try washing and drying your clothes in the bathroom. This is where the fast-drying clothing material comes into play.</li>\n \t<li>Make sure you have a spare change of clothes that won\u2019t be washed so you can still explore the city you are in while your clothes dry.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\" size-full wp-image-712 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/laundry.jpg\" alt=\"laundry\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" />\n\nTheses are just a few of the tips I have discovered about keeping clean while traveling. \u00a0If you have suggestions or your own stories you would like to share, please feel free to comment below.",

Ha, what logic that was.&nbsp; Way to go Katie.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[gallery ids=\"672,670,675\" type=\"square\" columns=\"2\"]\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-746\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161230_122944.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_122944\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_740\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"5312\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-740\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161230_110116.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_110116\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"> Enter some funny comment about me looking like Merida from the Disney movie Brave.[/caption]\n<h3>Surfs up dude</h3>\nChad was fascinated with the surfers resting on their boards in the water.&nbsp; He watched from the beach for the longest time and said we couldn\u2019t leave until he saw a really good ride.&nbsp; There must have been a newbie surfer in our view because he would fall just after standing up on the wave.&nbsp; We were going to be there forever if that one surfer determined our day\u2019s events.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-747\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161230_122956.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_122956\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">\n\nCoaxing Chad as if he were a stubborn ox, I lead him up the board walk out onto the giant pier.&nbsp; Big mistake.&nbsp; I thought the pier would allow us to see the massive waves up-close, and it did, but it also exposed the other side of the ocean.&nbsp; This side hosted black dots of surfers for as long as the eye could see and the surfers were at all different skill levels.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_743\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"265\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-743 alignleft\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161230_1222571.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20161230_122257\" width=\"265\" height=\"353\"> Crabby Chad captured while over looking his surfers[/caption]\n\n\u201cI just want to see one good run,\u201d said Chad, with his head in his hands and elbows resting on the old wood pier.&nbsp; I left him there and continued on my own adventure to the end of the pier and caught sight of a tamed pelican sitting on a wood pillar.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere were people of all colors, backgrounds and locations mingling around me.&nbsp; I loved the diversity and would purposefully position myself next to different groups of people to over hear their accents or stories they were sharing.\n\nI was just starting to create scenarios for some of the families (ex. Where they had come from, where they were going, what the kid with the sucker in his mouth was complaining about\u2026) and Chad wandered over.&nbsp; Really Chad, now you are ready?&nbsp; The rest of the morning at the ocean was filled with occasional teasing, silence and taking in the beautiful force of the crashing waves.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_677\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"591\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-677 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161230_122248.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20161230_122248\" width=\"591\" height=\"333\"> Chad evaluating the surfer talent. &nbsp;Black dots in water are surfers.[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Zoooooooooo</h3>\n<img class=\"  wp-image-733 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161230_161636.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_161636\" width=\"552\" height=\"310\">\n\nApparently, the San Diego Zoo is the zoo to go to.&nbsp; Uh huh, and if the more expensive something is the more value it holds.&nbsp; We paid $50 some dollars per ticket (the cheapest deal) to go to the zoo. Chad and I (more me than Chad) were going to see every gosh darn thing this zoo had to offer.&nbsp; Semi sober from being grumpy, Chad was uber thrilled to go to a place where there would be a ton of people (not).\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-749 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161230_155837.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_155837\" width=\"443\" height=\"249\">\n\nThe crummy, no sun weather was turning out to be working in our favor because the zoo was hardly busy according to a lady I spoke with while Chad used the restroom.&nbsp; She was there the day before when the weather was nice and she said the zoo was buzzing with people.&nbsp; Today, she said, was very slow and there were hardly any people.&nbsp; This excited me because then Chad wouldn\u2019t be as frustrated and I could enjoy quickly moving from exhibit to exhibit without dodging small children or strollers.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-725 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161230_145441.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_145441\" width=\"537\" height=\"302\">To our horror once getting inside the gates, there were people everywhere rushing around and giant double decker tour buses cruising by with loud speakers describing the park to the passengers.&nbsp; So much for a \u201cslow\u201d day.&nbsp; I couldn\u2019t image a busy day at this zoo.&nbsp; Maybe a busy day at the San Diego Zoo could be relatable to a normal day at the Minnesota State Fair with walls of people traveling the isles between the animal exhibits.&nbsp; Ew.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur zoo ticket came with a ride on the bus, so we hopped on right away and zoomed around the entire zoo.&nbsp; Our driver explained facts about the animals we passed, gave us the history of when the animals joined the zoo and told us about eating habits.&nbsp; This tour was helpful because we got to see everything in the zoo, learned the behind the scenes care for specific species and more about the purposes of the park.\n\n[gallery ids=\"729,726,727,728\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nMy favorite part of the zoo was the rainforest because we were able to walk through a path that hosted many varieties of plants which eventually lead to a giant bird cage.&nbsp; Having driven through a lot of land that does not have very many green trees or water, I was reminded Minnesota.&nbsp; Oh, seeing the rhinos and the hippos were pretty great too.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-748 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161230_153038.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_153038\" width=\"573\" height=\"322\">\n\nChad is a super fan of reptiles, especially snakes (not).&nbsp; We ventured to the reptile house and examined all of the different species of snakes, frogs and salamanders.&nbsp; Some of those suckers were pretty big and I wouldn\u2019t want to run into them either.&nbsp; Having the glass between life and death was comforting.&nbsp; We both agreed that we didn\u2019t want to come across these specimens anywhere else.\n\n[gallery ids=\"731,730,732\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n<h3>Rain Rain Rain</h3>\nDinner was supposed to be outdoors under cabanas at a Mexican restaurant in the very old, original part of San Diego, Old Town,&nbsp;with Chad\u2019s friend AJ, AJ\u2019s sister and their four friends.&nbsp; The rain sprinkled at first when we arrived and the place was packed. &nbsp;The waiters, dressed in old Spanish style suits, were running around opening canopies and the waitresses, dressed in old style Spanish dresses with lace, delivered food as fast as they could.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_735\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"545\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-735 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161230_182314.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_182314\" width=\"545\" height=\"306\"> The enterance to the restaurant[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_734\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"546\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-734 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161230_182209.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_182209\" width=\"546\" height=\"308\"> Outdoor stage right next to the restaurant about to put on a play[/caption]\n\nWe all filled up on chips and salsa while waiting for our server to return to take our orders.&nbsp; Most of us settled for appetizers for our meals and we left waddling out to the parking lot.&nbsp; It was practically pouring by now and I was thankful we ate indoors.&nbsp; The brave souls who still ate at their outside tables seemed drenched and very chilled.&nbsp; Welcome to San Diego, a wet beach town.\n\nChad\u2019s mood did cheer up and it was really nice to be in a location for an entire day without driving.&nbsp; While being constantly around someone and having no breaks, it was nice to have quiet time when visiting the beach or while walking around exploring.&nbsp; The trip so far has hosted very little disagreements, no arguments to speak of and it seems like we are enjoying each other\u2019s company.",

Thinking I would only rest my eyes, I actually fell asleep for at least 30 minutes.&nbsp; I woke up startled, not knowing where I was and was very relieved that Chad was sitting on the next bench over.&nbsp; It never occurred to me until that moment that he could have just left me there to sleep and went on his merry way.&nbsp; Thank you Chad for not leaving me in a random state so far from home!\n\nNot long after waking up, a lady came up the path and starred at the ocean with coffee in hand.&nbsp; We made jokes with her about morning coffee and the ocean waves which lead to a brief conversation with her.&nbsp; As she was describing her story about choosing this town for retirement, she looked over and pointed across the waves.&nbsp; A large black object rose out of the waves then a giant whale tale flipped out of the water.&nbsp; In bewilderment, we all stared out to see if it would pop out of the water again, but it kept on its course.&nbsp; The local told us that it\u2019s rare for us to see the orcas and we spotted one!\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-814 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_131623.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_131623\" width=\"571\" height=\"321\">\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_816\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"378\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-816 alignleft\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_135820.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_135820\" width=\"378\" height=\"673\"> \"I'm whaley wet from the rain.\"[/caption]\n\n\u201cHow long have you guys been together?\u201d came the random question from the local lady.&nbsp; Chad and I looked at each other and laughed.&nbsp; We responded and gave a little back ground as to what we were up to with the 3-week road trip.&nbsp; Her eyebrows shot up in surprise and told us, \u201cif you can go on a road trip with each other and sleep in the car, you guys are good to go.\u201d Then begins to hum the wedding bells chorus, \u201cdum dum dum dum, dum dum dum dum.\u201d\nWe all burst out laughing and she started to retreat to her waiting husband in the car.&nbsp; She then smirked, laughed and said that this garden is a great place to become engaged.&nbsp; \u201cWith the ocean in the background, it\u2019s perfect!\u201d\n\n\u201cEw, ew, ew,\u201d said Chad as she left and we both laughed the encounter off.&nbsp; No engagements today if we could help it!\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Huntington Beach Caves</h3>\nStopping for coffee and treats at Starbucks in a random town, I joked with the cashier about not knowing where we were.&nbsp; She was almost appalled that I didn\u2019t know I was in Huntington Beach.&nbsp; Well fine, let\u2019s go find this beach!\n\n[gallery ids=\"842,817\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nChad found the beach and made sure he let me know that HE had found it.&nbsp; This is because Chad always has great ideas and they have a high percentage of actually working out. &nbsp;He wanted to just look at it.&nbsp; Screw that, I wanted to touch the ocean and feel the sand.&nbsp; I raced down the steep slope and was amazed with what I found at the bottom.\n\n[gallery ids=\"820\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nImagine a sappy romance novel set in a beach town where the couples sneak off to the beach caves in the dead of night.&nbsp; I found the caves!&nbsp; This was the first time coming into contact with rough rocks and cliffs where I could explore the caves below.&nbsp; Begging Chad to come explore with he, he shook his head vigorously nooooooooo as he did not want any chance of recreating any beginnings of a romance novel.&nbsp; Fine, suit yourself!&nbsp; I went on to explore without him and he kept his distance to view the ocean.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_845\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-845\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_153440.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_153440\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> I would like to point out the cacti on the beach[/caption]\n\nI discovered small tide pools that hosted sea anemones that I played with using a stick to make them close their flailing arms.&nbsp; They were all over the rocks in and out of the water, obviously waiting for the tide to come in to open up again.&nbsp; The waves were crashing into the rocks and there was a fear of getting completely soaked without warning.\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-821\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_154001.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_154001\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"></h3>\n[gallery ids=\"824,825\" type=\"square\" columns=\"1\" orderby=\"rand\"]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-843\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_153307.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_153307\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">\n<h3>A not so happy New Year</h3>\n<img class=\"  wp-image-853 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_163641.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_163641\" width=\"519\" height=\"292\">\n\nSkirting around Los Angeles, I hunted down a sea food dinner in Santa Monica.&nbsp; We went to the Water Grill and we skipped the reservation by claiming spots at the bar.&nbsp; We had a small feast of raw delicacies like oysters, crab, snails, and mussels with a bowl of clam chowder.&nbsp; It was great to have the fresh sea food but the quantity was not very filling for $70.&nbsp; I can check that off having fresh seafood by the ocean off my bucket list.\n\n[gallery ids=\"855,854,856\" type=\"rectangular\" orderby=\"rand\"]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_848\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"559\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-848 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_153950.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_153950\" width=\"559\" height=\"314\"> View from inside the beach caves[/caption]\n\nIt was time to look for places to sleep and we didn\u2019t want to be in city limits for safety reasons.&nbsp; While walking back to the car after dinner, we could see a pier reaching into the water decked with flashing lights of an amusement park.&nbsp; The streets were scattered with people looking for New Year\u2019s dinner and strange figures resting in the dark for the night.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_827\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"516\"]<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-827\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_162611.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_162611\" width=\"516\" height=\"290\"> We drove by a Ferrari dealership and had to take a peak[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_828\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"518\"]<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-828\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_162808.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_162808\" width=\"518\" height=\"291\"> There they are![/caption]\n\nWe walked by a few benches and Chad said he found my place to sleep for the night, the bench.&nbsp; Clinging to his arm, I talked about being a leech and not letting go.&nbsp; He didn\u2019t like this at all, you know because public affection is basically a sin with him, and I let go on the condition of me still being allowed to join him on this trip.&nbsp; I\u2019m still waiting for the incident where one of us will be hopping a flight back to Minnesota while the other drives because we can\u2019t stand being around each other anymore.\n\n[gallery ids=\"851,850,849\" type=\"rectangular\" orderby=\"rand\"]\n\nSearching for places to sleep yielded very few safe sleeping locations and we headed out of town to drive as far as we could.&nbsp; Being the Navigator, I was in charge of finding a sleeping place.&nbsp; I had a hotel parking lot lined up and when we got there, the hotel had hired parking lot guards.&nbsp; Obviously this was not going to work and it also told us that this neighborhood where ever we were was not sleeping worthy.&nbsp; This mistake cost us an hour of drive time but I was able to use a restroom in a fast food burger joint.&nbsp; Yippee.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-824 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_154110.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_154110\" width=\"536\" height=\"301\">\n\nGetting back into the car, fireworks were lit off and this signaled the new year.&nbsp; Two tired, crabby people stared at each other in the car and we shrugged. Here\u2019s to starting the new year in a random town in California, exhausted, still hungry from lack of dinner food and nowhere near a camping place for the night.&nbsp; At least we were still on talking terms, but barely since I miss calculated sleeping arrangements.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_847\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"538\"]<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-847\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_153816.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_153816\" width=\"538\" height=\"303\"> Giant homes on the beach[/caption]\n\n[gallery ids=\"819,818\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nThe early morning ended at a truck stop around 2am and we went through the motions of getting ready for bed.&nbsp; What an exhausting day and to think it was a holiday.&nbsp; We car camped with 3 other car neighbors and didn\u2019t stay up later than we needed to.&nbsp; All this driving was starting to wear on our bodies and we were beginning to always be tired.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_826\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"587\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-826 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20161231_155102.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_155102\" width=\"587\" height=\"330\"> Had to take a picture pretending to be the Little Mermaid[/caption]\n\nWe ended the night all nestled into our sleeping bags and recounted the day\u2019s events, laughing at the random stranger at the ocean overlook, the whales, the stretches of beaches and the mishap with the sleeping spot.&nbsp; We were able to laugh it off and rested deeply until almost 10am.&nbsp; It wasn\u2019t the typical New Year celebration, but we were still on talking terms so I didn\u2019t complain one bit!",

    "content": "<h2>Day 16 Location: San Francisco and Fort Bragg, California</h2>\n<h3>Blurred world</h3>\nSleeping in without a set alarm, we both woke up late after last night\u2019s long hours on the road.\u00a0 When taking off a sleeping mask always, always, always take it off under the blankets or put your face into something to help your eyes adjust to the light.\u00a0 I forgot about this and ripped off my mask and was instantly blinded by the brightest light I have ever seen.\n\nIt could be described as a white light that caused instant, very intense pain.\u00a0 My vision for the next 5 hours was blurred and I couldn\u2019t see near or far.\u00a0 Nothing was coming into focus and I couldn\u2019t even see Chad\u2019s face while he sat in the driver\u2019s seat next to me.\u00a0 For having 20/20 vision on the daily, this was terrifying.\n\nDecked out in sunglasses. I went into the gas station to clean up and had to rely on all of my other senses to make sure I used the correct bathroom.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t believe my vision was that bad.\n\nChad obviously had to drive and we spend the morning driving through groves of trees, hills and cattle pastures.\u00a0 Chad had to describe them to me of course because I couldn\u2019t make out any of the details except for the shapes.\u00a0 Huge orange groves or other nut trees were everywhere for miles.\u00a0 The day before had oil pumps dotting the landscape, with large oil tankers resting in the bay along the coast.\u00a0 What a drastic change in scenery.\u00a0 California was sure throwing us a few curve balls.\n\nBrunch time came around and we hopped out of the car for gas, ate a sad burger and I finished off the frozen yogurt.\u00a0 Chad thought my eyes looked extremely dry and we picked up eye drops.\u00a0 With multiple treatments throughout the day, my sight was restored.\u00a0 Weird.\n<h3>Sweet and Sour Chicken Craze</h3>\nSan Francisco was our destination for lunch and I had less than 10 minutes to decide where we were going to eat.\u00a0 We paid for the bridge (we didn\u2019t expect that) and drove into the impressive skyline.\u00a0 There were tons of cars all going the same way and realized that the bridge was a double-decker.\u00a0 There were cars leaving the city under us on another ramp.\u00a0 We would have to come back and visit for sure, there was not enough time to spend in this city this time.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_920\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"573\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-920 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170101_134244.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_134244\" width=\"573\" height=\"322\" /> Waiting to pay to cross the bridge[/caption]\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-919 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170101_134115.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_134115\" width=\"574\" height=\"322\" />\n\nThe reviews of a restaurant said we were going to eat the best Reuben ever, but when we got to the shop it was closed because of New Year\u2019s Day.\u00a0 We walked the strip of the section we were in looking for other food.\u00a0 I loved the architecture and watching the chaos of buses, people and listening to all of the new city sounds.\u00a0 There was a sign for Chinese food in front of a shop and it looked delicious!\u00a0 Chad thought it was going to be lame American Chinese food; we were wrong.\u00a0 This was literally the best Chinese food I have ever eaten.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-934 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170101_153936.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_153936\" width=\"589\" height=\"331\" />\n\n[gallery ids=\"933,932,931\" type=\"circle\"]\n\nYou the food is authentic when the only people in the restaurant are the people who come from that culture.\u00a0 We hit the jack pot.\u00a0 Ugh, ever since that meal I am extremely disappointed with any of the sweet and sour chicken I try.\u00a0 This chicken we had in San Francisco was crunchy, had an obvious homemade orange chicken sauce and left a zing of citrus in your mouth.\u00a0 Thank you Tai Chi Restaurant!\u00a0 We highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area.\n\n[gallery ids=\"923,924,925\" type=\"square\" columns=\"2\" orderby=\"rand\"]\n<h3>Cliff Sleeping</h3>\nUsing the freecampsites.net website, we had found a free area to sleep that was apparently right on an ocean cliff next to Fort Bragg.\u00a0 From San Francisco, the drive was about 3.5 hours and we left the city as the sun was going down.\u00a0 To get to Fort Bragg, we traveled the scenic route for a little way on Highway 1 but once it was dark, we hopped onto Highway 101.\u00a0 This saved us at least two hours of driving.\n\n[gallery ids=\"935,937\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nWe couldn\u2019t see much of what we were passing so we paid more attention to our audio book.\u00a0 As of now, we have finished the first Outlander book and had eagerly started the second book, Dragon Fly in Amber.\u00a0 For those of you who want to know, the audio book length for Outlander is 32 hours and 43 minutes.\u00a0 Chad and I have listened to every single word on that book so that means we have been driving in the car for a minimum of the book length.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-926 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170101_140015.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_140015\" width=\"548\" height=\"308\" />\n\nWe didn\u2019t have the book playing the entire time while driving into different states, but it\u2019s still crazy to think that we sat and listened to over 32 hours of one book.\u00a0 Now hooked on the story line, we began the second without a blink of an eye.\u00a0 This book is 38 hours and 58 minutes long.\u00a0 Our goal was to finish the book before we were home in Minnesota.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_927\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"465\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-927 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170101_140050.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_140050\" width=\"465\" height=\"261\" /> This is very impressive parking[/caption]\n\nThe sharp winding roads had led us through flat land which transitioned into thick, tall pine trees.\u00a0 The rain had finally broken and it was pouring the majority of the way to the campsite.\u00a0 While the temperature hovered around 33 and 32 degrees, Chad navigated through the slick turns, trying not to launch us off into the dark.\u00a0 Our high beams were starting to catch glimpses of massive tree trunks and we realized the road was designed to move around them.\u00a0 We were getting into red wood forest territory and I couldn\u2019t wait to see the giant trees in the daylight.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_930\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"587\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-930 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170101_142245.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_142245\" width=\"587\" height=\"330\" /> A hot mess of train wires littered the sky[/caption]\n\nWe arrived at our location just before midnight and we settled into the best camping spot ever.\u00a0 The rain had slowed to a cold drizzle and we could hear the angry waves crashing as we shut off the car.\u00a0 It was very dark and looking out the windows we could see thousands of stars because there was no light pollution emanating from the large cities.\n\n[gallery ids=\"928,929,937,938\" type=\"rectangular\" orderby=\"rand\"]\n\nI am not afraid of heights, but I am very afraid of falling.\u00a0 I stayed in the car while Chad went investigate our new lawn and cliff in the front of our mobile car-house. \u00a0The black figure carried his flashlight only 15 yards away from the car, paused, and I saw the bobbing light returning quickly to the car.\u00a0 Chad doesn\u2019t get nervous often and he expressed that he was not going to explore this cliff in the dark because it was a sheer drop off.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad I stayed in the car.\n\n[gallery

    "content": "<h2>Day 17 Location: Northern California, the Redwood Forest</h2>\nThe night before we had parked our car on the edge of a cliff, not knowing what was below.&nbsp; In the morning light, our view from inside the car was still obstructed from the moisture clinging to the windows.&nbsp; As soon as we cleared them, the view was breath taking.&nbsp; I\u2019ll let the pictures do the talking.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_985\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-985\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_081704.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_081704\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> View from my side of the car[/caption]\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-990\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_081818.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_081818\" width=\"10496\" height=\"1600\">\n\nNot wanting to leave, we back tracked to the nearest town to grab a bite to eat then quickly turn around to continue driving north to see the Redwood forest.&nbsp; As we were driving back past our cliff camping spot, someone was parked in the lot taking pictures.&nbsp; We had avoided the tourists!\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-988\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_081732.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_081732\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">\n\n[gallery ids=\"987,989,991\" type=\"rectangular\" orderby=\"rand\"]\n\nThe road immediately took us into the surrounding hills and popped us back to the ocean side often.&nbsp; The roads we were driving on last night held many treasures that would could now see in the day light.&nbsp; We had been passing through thick forests of the largest trees I will ever see in my life.&nbsp; Dotted here and there, these ginormous trees loomed above us to cover the road in archways with their branches. Some trees even caused the road to quick turn to go around the trunks.\n\n[gallery ids=\"989,993,992\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nThis post will be mainly pictures because there are so many cool shots I want to share.&nbsp; We never went to the National Redwood Forest because the trees were everywhere along the highway and we found ourselves in places where there weren\u2019t a lot of people.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-994 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_103149.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170102_103149\" width=\"552\" height=\"310\">\n\nThe weather was terrible.&nbsp; When I say terrible, we literally had every kind of weather you can image happen to us on this day.&nbsp; Sunny, cloudy, windy, not windy, cold, hot, rain, sleet and snow.&nbsp; I joked about what can happen next and it instantly started hailing.&nbsp; WHAT?!\n\n[gallery ids=\"995,998,996\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nThe roads we traveled led us through small towns and tourist traps.&nbsp; But, one in particular was exactly what I was looking for.&nbsp; I wanted to drive through a tree and we did precisely that.&nbsp; I couldn\u2019t see anywhere near the top of the tree and the branches grew out, turned directly 90 degrees and continued growing upward.&nbsp; The thickness of this \u2018branch\u2019 was exactly the size of a full grown tree.&nbsp; How in the word does this tree support all of the weight!?\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1102\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_120131.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_120131\" width=\"2984\" height=\"5312\">\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-999 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_114452.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170102_114452\" width=\"443\" height=\"787\">\n\nChad and I detoured through the Avenue of the Giants, saying that this would suffice for not going into the actual Redwood Forest.&nbsp; The trees are nothing special, they look like any other regular tall pine tree you would see up north.&nbsp; But the sheer size of the average tree trunk was bigger than the length of our Diesel Jetta.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1000\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"502\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-1000 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_114544.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170102_114544\" width=\"502\" height=\"898\"> Do you see Chad?[/caption]\n\nI convinced Chad to park a few times to get out and explore at the base of the trees.&nbsp; One particular time we traveled further than the designated tourist area to explore away from the road.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1001\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1001\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_114657.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_114657\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> Can you see the chared bark from previous forest fires?[/caption]\n\nAccording to pamphlet I grabbed at the beginning of the Avenue, this area had never been logged or touched by humans other than putting a road through this location.&nbsp; It was truly obvious.&nbsp; The trees when they died or were blown over, fell in straight rows.&nbsp; The trunks of the trees were so straight that when Chad and I went exploring, we walked on top of them as if they were highways or sidewalks in the forest.&nbsp; But to get on top of one of the fallen trees was another issue.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1002\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"423\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-1002 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_114710.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170102_114710\" width=\"423\" height=\"753\"> The base of the tree is not even close to being in the picture[/caption]\n\nStanding next to the fallen trunk, Chad (6 ft) couldn\u2019t even reach his hand out to touch the top of it.&nbsp; We had to find other rocks or fallen trees that had decayed enough in order to climb up onto the dead tree. &nbsp;It was sprinking rain and if you looked up, you could slowly see individual rain drops falling from the branches above. &nbsp;I made a game out of catching the drops in my mouth like you would with snow flakes.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1007,1008,1009\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nHaving been seeing the majestic trees all day, we cut the tour of the Avenue of the Giants short to hop onto the highway.&nbsp; It was late afternoon and we still had to go through mountainous terrain at the tip of California to get to Oregon.&nbsp; The weather seemed to be getting worse and decided to rush through areas to get as far as we could before freezing weather struck.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1004\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"582\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-1004 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_120427.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170102_120427\" width=\"582\" height=\"327\"> Can you spot Chad?[/caption]\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-1006 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_121249.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_121249\" width=\"484\" height=\"863\">\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1103\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"675\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-1103 alignright\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_1217311.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170102_121731\" width=\"675\" height=\"380\"> I'm inside the half hollowed-out log[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1010\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1010\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_132632.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_132632\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> Itty bitty ant cars compared to these trees[/caption]\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1011\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_133015.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_133015\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Georgia', serif;color:#3d596d;\">Royal's Model Shots for a Volkswagen Advertisement</span></h3>\n[gallery ids=\"1012,1013,1014\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n<h3>Yellow Eyes</h3>\n<img class=\"  wp-image-1015 alignleft\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_141812.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170102_141812\" width=\"218\" height=\"291\">The sun light was blocked from the large pines as we climbed in and out of mountain hills.&nbsp; Finally, we were spit out onto flat land and were greeted by the sight of a town, Crescent City, in the distance.&nbsp; I really needed to use the bathroom and none of the gas stations were open.&nbsp; We finally pulling into a Denny\u2019s and I stepped out hurriedly.\n\nFrom listening to the audio book, there was a scene describing the main character fighting bare handed with wolves, the look of hunger in the wolves\u2019 eyes and details describing how she escaped alive.&nbsp; As I stepped out of the car, door still swinging shut, I found myself not more than 5 feet away from a wolf-like animal staring at me with gold eyes.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1016,1017,1018\" type=\"rectangular\"]\n\nIt happened so fast, but time stood still for me.&nbsp; While stepping out of the car, the noise had woken a sleeping dog that was resting under the bushes surrounding the Denny\u2019s building.&nbsp; The large dog casually jumped down off the ledge retaining wall that housed the bushes and stood to stare at me from the sidewalk.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1020\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"534\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-1020 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_160037.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170102_160037\" width=\"534\" height=\"300\"> A herd of elk resting in the afternoon sun[/caption]\n\nMaintaining eye contact, I reached back to grab the still moving door and thrusted myself into the passenger seat panting as if I had just sprinted a 400-meter dash. \u201cThere -there\u2019s \u2013 THERE\u2019S A WOLF RIGHT THERE!\u201d I screamed as Chad looked up from Google Maps.&nbsp; I calmed down and leaned forward to watch my foe.&nbsp; It was a very large, wolf-like dog with matted brown and grey hair. &nbsp;It didn\u2019t seem to have a collar on as it lurked away through the parking lot.&nbsp; I sure did not want to go back outside but my bladder was going to burst any minute.&nbsp; Needless to say, I was very alert for a long time after this encounter.<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1100\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_1154131.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_115413\" width=\"2984\" height=\"5312\">",

it must have been a tourist trap that was closed for the winter season.\u00a0 I immediately thought the parking lot to this place could wrap around to the other side and bypass the tree.\u00a0 But, a Subaru Outback hosting 3 mountain teenagers, rolled up and tried to go around, just as I had imagined.\u00a0 They only made it about 20 feet before immediately reversing back onto the road.\u00a0 There was no way our small cars were going to get through the thick snow.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1029\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_210234.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_210234\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" />\n\nOk, so that back up plan was out.\u00a0 Looking forward to stare at the tree in our high beams, I noticed the pine had fallen from the left onto the road, but by doing so, had fallen onto a power line.\u00a0 Not only is there a tree in the road but there is also the reality that someone could be electrocuted if the line was still active.\n\nChad and I racked our brains for any information we knew about electric emergencies or how to deal with them.\u00a0 All we could come up with is the rubber of our tires are the only thing resistant to the electrical current.\u00a0 But that wouldn\u2019t help much because if Chad decided to drive over the tip of the pine tree, the branches would totally touch the side of metal car and could potentially electrocute us. We were stuck on a mountain.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1028\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1028\"

pulled out a chain saw from the back of the Subaru and was heading over to start hacking away the top of the tree.\u00a0 Chad got out and went to warn him about getting anywhere near the tree with the potential live current.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1030\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_210758.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_210758\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" />Drivers from the cars behind us started to come investigate the tree, walked right up to it and were touching the branches.\u00a0 Chad deemed this action as \u2018safe enough\u2019 and went to go look with the other guys standing around.\u00a0 The mountain teenager reared his chainsaw and marched over to the rescue.\u00a0 All of the guys that were standing around started to help clear the branches away as the kid cut.\n\n<img class=\"  wp-image-1023 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_163821.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_163821\" width=\"383\" height=\"683\" />\n\nI watched in amazement as the tip of the tree was slowly cleared away, and with every branch removed, there was more hope that we wouldn\u2019t be stuck on this mountain.\n\nI glanced over to see what Chad was up to, and right as I looked over, a branch Chad was tossing into the ditch came back to aggressively smack him on the left side of his face.\u00a0 I flinched for him and saw the culprits on the other side of him.\u00a0 A few other guys were throwing branches into the ditch when Chad was throwing his.\n\nWhen I asked Chad hours later, he said that their branch had fallen onto his branch which caused it to immediately kick back, hitting him in the face.\u00a0 The only damage suffered was a few small cuts around the eye, the side of the left temple and small bruising that became prominent the next day.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1026\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"307\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-1026 alignleft\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_170119.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_170119\" width=\"307\" height=\"547\" /> Hail![/caption]\n\nThe right side of the lane was almost clear when someone had grabbed a hold of the branch the chainsaw was cutting.\u00a0 The pulling motion derailed the chain on the saw and the process immediately stopped.\u00a0 Everyone started to go back to their cars and Chad bolted for our car.\n\nHe wanted to be the first one through to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be stuck behind people he couldn\u2019t trust driving through the mountain.\n\nPassing through the tight space on the road, we were immediately stopped by a mountain police officer that was waiting on the other side.\u00a0 This was one of the worst mistakes this officer could have made.\n\nThe snow had been falling heavily this entire time and when we came to a stop next to his vehicle, it was likely we wouldn\u2019t be able to pull forward without sliding into his car.\n\nHe apologized for making us stop (for literally nothing other than to look at us through our window) and we attempted to drive forward.\u00a0 We slid towards the cop car, stopped and retried until we scooted by without a scratch.\u00a0 Phew.\n\nDriving away was easy and we flew down the road with adrenaline pumping through our veins.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t think we were going to get out of that one!\n\nWhile driving on this road trip, we ask people on the side of the road it they need help and most of the time they say they have it covered.\u00a0 There was a car with hazards flashing and a guy looking under the hood of his car.\u00a0 The snow was still coming down relentlessly and it wouldn\u2019t be stopping anytime soon.\u00a0 To think the tree was bad enough, what happened next topped anything we have encountered on this trip.\n<h3>Winter storm weed</h3>\nThe car in distress had apparently run out of gas.\u00a0 The nearest gas station was 20 miles away, and with road conditions the way they are, it would take over an hour to get there and maybe not even make it back.\u00a0 The man was maybe in his late 40s, dressed in dark winter clothing, his face well-worn and was missing teeth.\u00a0 Looking inside the car, the passenger seat held a woman who I thought was his mother and instantly began to worry about their safety on a night like this.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1142\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"5312\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1142\"

were not bathrooms in sight[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1143\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"5312\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1143\"

and took a picture to share his art with me. \u00a0Guess how he made it?[/caption]\n\nChad offered to give them a ride to their house, which was only 3-ish miles up the road.\u00a0 I looked at him with horror.\u00a0 You can\u2019t trust anyone anymore and you are not supposed to pick up people on the side of the road if you value your safety/life.\u00a0 This was happening and they were getting in our car.\n\nChad and I cleared our sleeping gear and bags out the back seat and packed the trunk completely full.\u00a0 The two people piled into our car and the air instantly filled with the skunky smell of weed.\u00a0 Getting a closer look at the woman, she was almost the same age as the guy she was with and I assumed she was the girl friend.\u00a0 She also was missing teeth (I could only see 1 or 2), wasn\u2019t dressed for the weather and had a voice like a practiced chain smoker.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1112\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_1656501.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_165650\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\" />All of the alarm bells were going off in my head.\u00a0 What did we just do?\u00a0 Chad continued to drive steadily for the longest 3 miles of my life.\u00a0 The people in the back seat wouldn\u2019t shut up and the girl was talking 80 miles an hour.\n\nWe openly discovered, without having to hardly ask any questions, that they both were weed dealers and they thought we looked like Trimmers.\u00a0 Apparently, Trimmers are traveling people who come to cut the leaves off of the weed plants.\u00a0 The informed us that we were in Oregon and were laughing about how we didn\u2019t know weed was legal in this state.\u00a0 This was, in their opinion, the best place in the whole country to grow weed because of the climate.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1111\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_1656191.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_165619\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\" />They went on and on and on about their varieties, selling patterns, growing seasons and asked multiple times if we would like to purchase their products.\u00a0 They weren\u2019t paying any attention to the road and I had to keep reminding them to tell us where to go.\u00a0 We dipped off the road onto an unplowed dirt road that had only been driven on by the big super duty trucks.\n\nThe momentum from the small hill was the only thing keeping are car going forward and Chad hammered on the gas to propel us through the deep snow.\u00a0 Thank goodness for these freaking amazing Canadian snow tires.\u00a0 If a tree didn\u2019t stop us, this deep snow would and it almost did.\u00a0 The girl apologized for making us take this way because, \u201cI always take this road and didn\u2019t think about the snow.\u201d\u00a0 Well no duh lady.\n\nWe dropped them off outside a shack and they rolled out of the car. \u00a0Chad got out to check the back seat with his flash light and found the guy\u2019s wallet sitting on the seat.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 They thanked us, told us how to get out and we were on our way as fast as possible.\u00a0 We almost got stuck trying to get up a hill that lead to the main road and had to accelerate rapidly to barely make it onto the road.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1110\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170102_1654491.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_165449\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\" />If I was driving this entire time, we would have been toast.\u00a0 Now extremely exhausted from the drive all day and the few hours\u2019 events, we trucked out of the mountains as safely as we could.\u00a0 It took us 4 hours to get out of the mountain when it was supposed to take only around 2, but I can\u2019t complain because we never slid down the mountain, crashed into a tree, froze to death or had to spend the night with the weed dealers to wait out the storm.\u00a0 Completely shot, we fell instantly asleep at a truck stop not caring too much if people saw us sleeping or not.",

Exhaustion was setting in and we both did not want to get up in the morning.&nbsp; We have never set alarms on this trip, letting our bodies wake up naturally, but this time I would have appreciated physically swiping the snooze button on my phone.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_1182\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1182\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_132113.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_132113\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> Portland, Oregon[/caption]</p>\n<p>School would start in a few days for me and Chad would have to go back to work, but we were still on the opposite side of the country.&nbsp; We decided that we weren\u2019t going to camp again (physically parking the car to sleep) and our plan was to rally drive all the way home.&nbsp; Oh boy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Oregon</h3>\n<p>Oregon was nothing I ever expected it to be.&nbsp; There were large and small hills following the highway with shacks/houses decorating the ledges.&nbsp; Every town we drove through was very small and we kept driving without batting an eye.&nbsp; Our audio book at the time was getting really good, so good in fact, I can only remember the story line and not the scenery of what we were passing through.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">The Progression of Chad's beard growth over the course of the trip</h3>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"79,156,214,249,392,469,625,672,814,842,936,1017\" type=\"rectangular\"]</p>\n<p>Chad was still driving and would drive the rest of the day because he liked to.&nbsp; His appearance has changed drastically since we left Minnesota because of his beard.&nbsp; From time to time I would catch him stroking his beard as if he was thinking about a serious topic and the motion helped him to think clearly.&nbsp; Since we haven\u2019t been showering regularly and boycotting all shampoos/conditioners, his hair surprisingly still looked good.</p>\n<p>Slicked into the man bun, which is finally long enough for a pony tail since his last haircut, Chad fit well into the mountain surroundings.&nbsp; The lifestyle he is portraying with the long beard, long hair, athletic Patagonia clothing and diesel Jetta is strikingly similar to a wanderer or hippie.&nbsp; Maybe a classy, technical hippie.&nbsp; Not to mention he loves, absolutely loves, sleeping in the car.&nbsp; This trip has created a monster that will not enjoy coming back to reality.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">The Progression of Katie's hair curls over the course of the trip</h3>\n<p>The entire trip has been without shampoo or conditioner. &nbsp;The only treatment was intense scrubbing and rinsing of the scalp/hair. &nbsp;It would then be brushed when wet and left to air dry. &nbsp;You can see the difference in texture from the first picture to the last picture.</p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"92,203,249,392,616,670,816,825\" type=\"rectangular\"]</p>\n<p>Taking a look at myself, I was still wearing the same clothing from 2 or 3 days prior.&nbsp; It\u2019s hard to remember when the days all blend into one.&nbsp; Having kept up with our hygiene practices, we didn\u2019t stink and we still felt comfortable.&nbsp; I have also not been using shampoo or conditioner on the trip but instead have been intensely scrubbing then rinsing my hair.&nbsp; The natural oils have been able to build up for the first time ever and my curls are astounding.&nbsp; There\u2019s a catch: I have to rinse my hair out and let it air dry for the best results.&nbsp; If this doesn\u2019t happen, I will of course look like someone who hasn\u2019t take a shower for a long time.&nbsp; It\u2019s a fine line between beauty and homeless haha.</p>\n<p>By the end of the day, we had passed through Oregon entranced with our audio book and had set the course to Seattle for dinner.&nbsp; Chad, having an obsession with Starbuck\u2019s coffee shops, knew the original location was in Pike\u2019s Place Market.&nbsp; Not knowing what we would find, we made our way across Washington.&nbsp; By this time, we had eaten almost every horded piece of food in the car and we were looking forward to the delicacies the city would offer.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_1183\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"582\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-1183 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_162045.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170103_162045\" width=\"582\" height=\"327\"> Driving into Seattle during rush hour[/caption]</p>\n<p>I have been meaning to travel to Washington to visit my other family, the Hickmans, in Walla Walla.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we were unable to stop due to tight driving deadlines.&nbsp; During all four years of high school, I had spent my afternoons working in the Hickman\u2019s sheep barns helping with chores, lambing and moving sheep.&nbsp; I absolutely loved every minute of it, even when the sheep were being stupid.&nbsp; The Hickmans have recently up-rooted their farm, trekked across the country to Washington and have started a new life in the rolling hills of Walla Walla with their sheep.&nbsp; Visiting them should be my next vacation and I will totally be bringing my work boots to help out with the sheep.&nbsp; Having been away from manual labor or farm work for a few years, I can\u2019t believe I miss it.</p>\n<h3>Pike\u2019s Place</h3>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"1184,1185,1186\" type=\"rectangular\"]</p>\n<p>Rush hour in Seattle heading out of the city was horrendous.&nbsp; The line of cars were backed up for at least 20 miles out of the city.&nbsp; Yuck.&nbsp; Chad and I arrived in Seattle around 4:30 p.m. and headed straight for the market.&nbsp; We were starving and getting very crabby.&nbsp; The city had a different feel than San Francisco, but it was still refreshing to see compared to the little towns we had been passing all day.</p>\n<p><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-1187 size-medium\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_162429.jpg?w=168\" alt=\"20170103_162429\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\">The curse of staying hydrated in the car is not having an immediate bathroom to use.&nbsp; I had tried to stay hydrated all day but I was paying for it.&nbsp; We found a parking stop on the cobble stone in the heart of the market and I immediately was bathroom hunting.&nbsp; There were people everywhere, smells of foods I couldn\u2019t distinguish and colors galore.&nbsp; There was an actual market with fresh fruits and veggies, fish, sea food and roots.&nbsp; Everything looked so appetizing.&nbsp; But first, I needed a bathroom.</p>\n<p>We wandered inside the strip behind the stores to find an Asian family frantically running by me and Chad.&nbsp; The woman in the group looked like she also had to use the bathroom and I was thrilled.&nbsp; We followed them until they came to a bathroom but they didn\u2019t stop.&nbsp; I wanted to stop, over joyed that I can finally go, but Chad was persistent that we follow them.&nbsp; He claimed that they had a look on their faces like they were going to go find something amazing, but they had to hurry to get there.&nbsp; Chad thought that this group of people would lead us to the Holy Grail but my Holy Grail was through the woman\u2019s restroom door.</p>\n<p><img class=\"  wp-image-1188 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_162651.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170103_162651\" width=\"493\" height=\"277\"></p>\n<p>Not wanting to be left alone in a large city, I hurriedly followed after Chad as we trailed the Asian family.&nbsp; They scooted around corridors inside the building and we found ourselves standing outside a clam chowder restaurant.&nbsp; The Asian family looked absolutely thrilled that they had made it to this place on time before they closed and Chad was practically crawling out of his skin with this amazing discovery.&nbsp; Apparently, this place has won contests for the best clam chowder in the States multiple years in a row and we were about to try some.&nbsp; Chad could have been happier than a clam.&nbsp; See what I did there?</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1194 size-medium\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_164646.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"20170103_164646\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\">It was the best damn chowder I have ever had.&nbsp; We saddled up to the bar and tried our different chowders.&nbsp; We got there just in time because they were closing at 5 p.m. and it was 4:50 p.m.&nbsp; The line out of the shop was at least 10-15 people deep; all waiting to buy chowder before closing time.&nbsp; Wow.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1192 size-large\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_164033.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"20170103_164033\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"><img class=\"  aligncenter wp-image-1193 size-medium\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_164057.jpg?w=168\" alt=\"20170103_164057\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\">I had forgotten that I was going to burst from not using the bathroom.&nbsp; Oops. I rushed out of the chowder place and hunted for another bathroom.&nbsp; We both were hopelessly still hungry and were easily sucked into any appetizing food that was on display in the street.&nbsp; We settled for gyros sold to us from a Russian woman who complained of the cold (we could see our breath and a jacket was required). She told us about the use of legal marijuana in Washington and how she would rather stick to a good scotch for entertainment.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_1197\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1197\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_172634.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_172634\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> The first Starbucks ever[/caption]</p>\n<p><img class=\"  wp-image-1190 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_162841.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170103_162841\" width=\"546\" height=\"973\"></p>\n<p>The street air was littered with the aroma of weed and people were bumbling about obviously having a \u2018good time\u2019.&nbsp; Taking the suggestions of people who worked in the shops, we sought after homemade mac and cheese.&nbsp; At this time it was a food frenzy because all of the shops, except for a few, would be closing.&nbsp; If we were to get any of the suggested items, we had to hustle.&nbsp; Running from shop to shop, Chad and I loaded up on varieties of food.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_1191\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1191\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_163620.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_163620\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> The view from our car[/caption]</p>\n<p><img class=\"  wp-image-1196 alignleft\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_170831.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170103_170831\" width=\"248\" height=\"444\">Gyros and mac in hand, we went back to the car to eat.&nbsp; I may or may not have walked through a group of guys that were standing by the car that seemed \u2018questionable\u2019 because they were so baked.&nbsp; I didn\u2019t think anything of it and when I got in the car I was sternly reminded that I should be more aware of my surroundings (aka sketchy people). Yes, good point.&nbsp; I was just so consumed with the thoughts of eating my gyro!</p>\n<p>Scarfing down everything, it was time for dessert.&nbsp; We high tailed it back to a German dessert shop and got our hands on some pretty bomb pastries.&nbsp;

All I remember leaving the city and seeing the lights as we passed by.&nbsp; Traffic was still bad but I remember beginning the climb into the mountains.&nbsp; I fell asleep to the audio book and occasionally came to and would look outside to see snow, mountain rocks and high beam lights.&nbsp; Deeming this unimportant, I would fall back asleep.</p>\n<p>Waking up as Chad pulled into a gas station, I thought I had only passed out for about an hour.&nbsp; He showed me the time on his phone and I didn\u2019t understand it.&nbsp; The time was 3:30 but I didn\u2019t know if it was a.m. or p.m..&nbsp; A groggy mind really confused me and I realized it was 3 in the morning!&nbsp; Chad had been driving my unconscious self across Washington for 6 hours.&nbsp; He looked absolutely awful.&nbsp; This hair was a mess, his eyes blood shot and there were huge dark rings under his eyes.&nbsp; It was totally my turn to drive.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_1189\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"608\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-1189 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_162837.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170103_162837\" width=\"608\" height=\"341\"> Heading to the Market[/caption]</p>\n<p>Chad was passed out even before I was able to get back onto the highway.&nbsp; My suggestion to night drivers or people who aren\u2019t used to long driving times at night: get an audio book or podcast.&nbsp; The book literally saved me from falling asleep because I had to pay attention to the storyline.&nbsp; It was peaceful traveling through the remainder of the mountains (I had forced Chad to drive them if he wanted to live) and watching the landscape change from hilly to flat.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_1198\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"596\"]<img class=\"  wp-image-1198 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170103_173814.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170103_173814\" width=\"596\" height=\"335\"> Watching the backed-up traffic from the Market overlook[/caption]</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">Obstacles Katie Avoided in the Road</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A large tumble weed the size of a Christmas tree</li>\n<li>An 8\u2019 ladder in the left lane</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"  wp-image-1202 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170104_074954.jpg?w=1700\" alt=\"20170104_074954\" width=\"584\" height=\"438\"></p>\n<p>Having avoided obstacles in the road, I caught up to the part in the book where Chad ended when I had woken.&nbsp; Woot Woot, 6 hours!&nbsp; We rallied like this all the way across Washington, Idaho, Montana and North Dakota.&nbsp; It was so discouraging to be driving through Fargo around dinner time because I couldn\u2019t stay and go back to my apartment.&nbsp; All of my things and my car were back in Minnesota waiting patiently for me to return.&nbsp; Chad and I could have spent the night at my place, said hi to my lonely roommate and stretched but it was easier to complete the remaining 4-hour drive.&nbsp; If we stop now, there is no way we are getting back in the car to keep driving.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_1201\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1201\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170104_074944.jpg\" alt=\"20170104_074944\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> My first real view of Montana - Chad is fast asleep[/caption]<br>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1203\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"3264\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1203\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170104_075345.jpg\" alt=\"20170104_075345\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"> Feeling sad knowing the trip is almost over[/caption]</p>\n<p>We had dinner at Johnny Carino\u2019s in Fargo, an Italian restaurant, to stock up on comfort food.&nbsp; This was our last meal while on vacation and reality was literally starring me in the face (NDSU campus is not that far away and my apartment just up the road).&nbsp; I drove the rest of the way back to Woodbury, MN.&nbsp; We arrived at a decent hour around 11 p.m. and the trip was over.&nbsp; But the audio book wasn\u2019t!&nbsp; We had only 40 minutes to go!&nbsp; Dragging our car-worn bodies into the house, it was a relief to be home in Minnesota.</p>\n<p><img class=\"  wp-image-1205 aligncenter\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170104_180728.jpg\" alt=\"20170104_180728\" width=\"573\" height=\"322\"></p>\n<h2>Day 20 Location: Woodbury, Minnesota</h2>\n<p>In the morning, Chad caught up on emails while I emptied the car.&nbsp; Having pulled everything out, I found items that I didn\u2019t know we brought.&nbsp; More than half of the things I hauled out weren\u2019t even used.&nbsp; This proves that we can bring a small amount of items next time and still be fine.&nbsp;

Keep and improve upon personal hygiene methods/routines to keep you and your travel partners happy.  No one likes sitting next to a sack of ripe onions.

Take a hike, go for a walk around your destination or even consider running laps around the local truck stop.  Do something to extend your muscles to help reduce stiff joints.

This could include yoga mats, roller blades, tennis rackets, hiking and camping equipment, 5+ gallons of water, a little bit of extra food and the minimal amount of clothing/footwear needed to complete your trip.  </li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each trip will test your prepping skills and there will be cases where you aren't as prepared as you would like to be.

If it's the reverse, there is way too much stuff and not enough space for souvenirs.  Wish us luck!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

They went sooner rather than later! :)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Take Me OUT of the Ball Game</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Exhausted and way past our bedtime, we said \u2018screw it\u2019 and made camp in the front row of the Bass Pro Shop.&nbsp; This time, we hung a blanket across the passenger side of the car (the side that faces the road and walkways), stuffed a sleeping bag into the front windshield and piled a few things in the back window of the car.&nbsp; When viewed from the outside, you couldn't see in at all.&nbsp; Beautiful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once asleep, we were suddenly woken by fireworks exploding from the stadium.&nbsp; My heart was pounding as I bolted out of a deep sleep.&nbsp; They were pretty and I had a direct view in my reclined position.&nbsp; It was the comfiest fireworks show I had ever been to!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:jetpack/tiled-gallery {\"ids\":[1737,1738,1739]} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-tiled-gallery aligncenter is-style-rectangular\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__gallery\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__row\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" data-height=\"2988\" data-id=\"1737\" data-link=\"http://katherine-marie.com/20190404_175011/\" data-url=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190404_175011.jpg?w=640\" data-width=\"5312\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190404_175011.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" data-height=\"2988\" data-id=\"1738\" data-link=\"http://katherine-marie.com/20190404_175051/\" data-url=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190404_175051.jpg?w=640\" data-width=\"5312\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190404_175051.jpg\" /></figure></div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" data-height=\"5312\" data-id=\"1739\" data-link=\"http://katherine-marie.com/20190404_181933/\" data-url=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190404_181933.jpg?w=575\" data-width=\"2984\" src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190404_181933.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n<!-- /wp:jetpack/tiled-gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, floods of people started to come back to their cars.&nbsp; BEEP, BEEP, BEEP sounded the car alarm in front of us.&nbsp; Chad, dead asleep, darted straight up for our keys thinking it was our car.&nbsp; A loud group of people walked up the alarming car and finally shut the noise off.&nbsp; UGH.

The morning was humid and damp from the rain last night.&nbsp; Somehow after sleeping in many Cracker Barrels parking lots, we haven't gone into have food. Maybe we will have to do that sometime!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today we were focusing on hitting the French Quarter to visit Cafe Du Monde for coffee and to tackle an Italian sandwich. It's a famous Italian sandwich called the Muffalata and it's layered with different varieties of Italian meats and cheeses. It sounds good, but we weren't sure what size to get!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2044} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://katherinemariedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20190413_081301.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2044\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were able to find parking at a lot right behind Cafe Du Monde; super lucky guess on my part, and we strolled the streets on the way to the cafe.

alternate route which happened to\ntake us into the back-country hills.&nbsp; It\nwas still on a highway, but it wasn\u2019t the main highway we had been traveling\nall day\u2026.. it was pitch black, there are moose and deer crossing signs\neverywhere and we had to travel slower to avoid potential suicidal animals. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It took over 40 kilometers to get out of there, but it took over\nand hour because of the slower speed limit and the choice of not totally our\ncar on a massive moose going for a nightly stroll. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually, we crossed onto the real highway 103 and booked it to\nthe top of Maine for rest.&nbsp; Chad located\na Wal-Mart in a French mountain town only 30 minutes away from the Highway 1\nMile Marker in Maine.&nbsp; That is our\ndestination point for the East Coast! (we took a picture at highway 1 mile 0 in\nthe Florida Key\u2019s).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Three other van campers were there with us and we rested well in\nthe cold air.&nbsp; Tomorrow, we will cross\nthe border back into the U.S.&nbsp; Hopefully,\nwe won\u2019t have any issues! </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

have slept at in Canada and we felt kinda uncomfortable\nlol.&nbsp; There were no car campers or\nRVs!&nbsp; So, we found a spot in the back and\nsettled in. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Right when we were about to fall asleep, two SUVs pulled up literally\ntwo spaces away from us and joined the sleeping parade.&nbsp; But why so close!?!&nbsp; The occupants of both cars got out (maybe two\nor three people??), started to unload gear and worked in the semi-dark (parking\nlot lights were pretty decent) to set up a tent.&nbsp; They literally camped at Wal-Mart on the\ngrass next to the lot!&nbsp; It was a nice\nlittle green tent, but I appreciated the solid car more.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No friendly Minnesota
