Unfortunately, I will have to wait for him to feel ready to leave. Today marks mile zero in Katie and Chad\u2019s road trip adventure to the west coast.\n\n<img src=\"/images/chad-is-stubborn/usa-road-map.gif\" alt=\"usa-road-map\" width=\"3060\" height=\"2076\">We will be hoping our trek will take us to Colorado, Arizona and California with random stops and states in between. But as of now, the car is not packed, Chad has decided to do everything under the sun before he even considers packing and I am patiently waiting for him to get his thoughts together.\n\nSoon we will be going on a trip of a life time! Over the course of this adventure, I will be documenting our travels as well as shedding light on the two characters in this story; Katie and Chad.\n<h3>5 Things to Bring On a Road Trip with Chad</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Ear buds \u2013 He insists on hands free phone calls</li>\n \t<li>Coconut oil \u2013 For burns, moisturizer, deodorant and used as cooking oil</li>\n \t<li>Canned venison \u2013 Apparently he likes to eat</li>\n \t<li>Hair Binders \u2013 Having a man bun is a lot of work</li>\n \t<li>Technical anything \u2013 If the supplies can be used technically then they are game to join on the adventure</li>\n</ol>\n<em><img src=\"/images/chad-is-stubborn/img_4081.jpg\" alt=\"img_4081\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\">\u201cKatie, we need survival tools and we are out of Dawn for my survival pack. We better go to the store and get it.\u201d - Chad</em>\n\nOn this trip I will be looking forward to seeing new sites, meeting unique people and understanding how two people can co-habit in a diesel Jetta for 3 weeks. There will be plenty of pictures, stories and thoughts to share as this trip unfolds.\n\nWith the conclusion of this post, Chad has finally settled and asked, <em>\u201care you sure you still want to go? You can back out now if you want to.\u201d</em>\n\nAnd so the trip begins\u2026<img src=\"/images/chad-is-stubborn/img_4082.jpg\" alt=\"img_4082\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\">",

    "content": "<h2>Day 2: Iowa, Nebraska and Colorado</h2>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Location: Des Moines, Iowa strip mall parking lot</span>\n\n<em>\u201cKatie, where is the ice scraper?\u201d </em>\n\nWhile sleeping in the car all bundled in our sleeping bags, the moisture from our breath had clung to the insides of the widows. This created a natural \u2018tinted window\u2019 and the illusion that our parked car was unoccupied. Adorned with sleeping masks, layers of Patagonia clothing and frost hanging from Chad\u2019s beard, our Sunday started at 5:30am due to the extremely cold temperatures.\n\nThe dash board on the Jetta read -12 degrees below zero, which is close to the temperatures we have been trying to avoid this holiday season. After aggressively searching the back seat, I could not locate the ice scraper and we listened to <a href=\"http://www.dianagabaldon.com/books/outlander-series/\">Outlander</a>, the first book of a multi-genre novel, for over an hour waiting for the car to defrost inside and out.\n\nThe inner city roads were silent, Interstate 80 was scattered with a light dusting of snow and the ditches were spotted with abandoned cars from last night\u2019s dangerous weather. We were fortunate that we made the decision to make camp in Des Moines instead of pursuing on to Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n30 minutes into Day 2, I found the ice scraper tucked next to the passenger seat and sheepishly finished scraping the inside of the windows with Chad. Oops.\n<h2>May I have some gas?</h2>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Location: All of Nebraska, Interstate 80</span>\n\n<img src=\"/images/lets-drive-all-of-the-miles/20161218_162900.jpg\" alt=\"20161218_162900\" width=\"298\" height=\"168\">Is there anything in Nebraska? Zooming along on the highway we encountered large herds of Black Angus cattle, a gazillion windmills (old and new), occasional ripple-looking hills of all sizes and thick dead grass. Rest stops seemed to be the only hub of excitement for us and one rest stop really surprised us.\n\n<img src=\"/images/lets-drive-all-of-the-miles/20161218_162913.jpg\" alt=\"20161218_162913\" width=\"403\" height=\"302\">\nAs I finished parking and was getting ready to sprint to the restroom (staying hydrated on a trip is hard when the nearest rest stop is 2 hours apart), Chad was approached on the passenger side by a lady holding cash. Long story short, the family of three had coasted into the rest stop on fumes because they ran out of gas and they had asked for a lift to the nearest gas station. *ALARM BELLS* Avoiding high-jacking or potential danger, we kindly took their gas can and went by ourselves to the gas station and returned their gas can free of charge.\n\nBUT, without this small detour and placing the gas can in our trunk, we wouldn\u2019t have noticed that our glass containers of Pellegrino water had shattered and left frozen bubbly water shot all over the trunk floor and items.\n\nNO FULL LIQUID CONTAINERS WHILE TRAVELING IN COLD WEATHER.\n\nAt the end of Day 2, we had driven 11 hours and made it to our first destination in Parker, Colorado. The GPS has now been set to avoid tolls, as that was a mistake on my part, and I was reunited with a long lost family friends - the Bourns/Christophers.<img src=\"/images/lets-drive-all-of-the-miles/20161219_104319.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_104319\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/lets-drive-all-of-the-miles/20161218_120804.jpg\" alt=\"20161218_120804\" width=\"320\" height=\"571\"><figcaption>Chad in his natural habitat - a coffee shop</figcaption></figure>\n\nChad is handling the trip well as the audio book has him captivated, work has been subdued until Monday and only shows signs of agitation when severely tired (go figure?).\n\nHe was convinced he wanted to sleep in the car again even though the opportunity to sleep in a warm bed presented itself. At the beginning of the trip he didn\u2019t want to get in the car and now he doesn\u2019t want to get out of it. Really Chad?",

    "content": "<h2>Day 3 Location: Colorado - Parker, Colorado Springs, Garden of the Gods, Breckenridge, Keystone, Grand Junction</h2>\nIt was wonderful seeing my friends in Parker, Colorado and I realized quickly that it was a whole 40 degrees outside (insert excitement and wearing summer clothes). Angela, our host and my family friend, had made wonderful biscuits and gravy for breakfast while her daughter Abby and I caught up with each other. Chad spent the morning working, devouring food and mapping out the next destination points.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/that-is-what-mountains-look-like/20161219_124703.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_124703\" width=\"542\" height=\"305\"><figcaption>Abby, Angela and me right after a delicious breakfast</figcaption></figure>\n\nAfter Chad was apparently \u201cdragged\u201d to Colorado with my request to see my friends, he quickly took an interest in the nearby mountains and ski resorts. He immediately called his ski patrol friends back home at Hyland Hills Ski Area, Bloomington and gathered suggestions for locations to spend a day skiing/snowboarding on a mountain. In my mind all I was thinking about was the location of my insurance card and where the nearest hospital is for when something crazy happens while skiing on a real mountain. This would be our first time skiing/snowboarding on a mountain as we are both are accustomed to the \u201cmountains\u201d Minnesota has to offer at our ski hills.\n\n<img src=\"/images/that-is-what-mountains-look-like/20161219_145937.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_145937\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">\n\nBut first, the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs. Saying thank you and goodbye to our Colorado friends, we packed the car. Once on the road, Chad was instantly ready to camp in the car and was looking forward to sleeping in the evening. I find this funny because with his current choice of Patagonia attire and facial hair, he totally fits the part of a wanderer and the temperament of all of the tree-huggers in the area. My attire consists of Patagonia and athletic gear to wick away moisture and hold off the body odor as long as possible. Showers are truly amazing and cherished\n\n<img src=\"/images/that-is-what-mountains-look-like/20161219_1506471.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_150647\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\">.\n\nThe Garden of the Gods was quiet with little tourist traffic. I was oh so lucky to drive through the park, a privilege apparently, since I am notorious for killing the manual car.\n\n<img src=\"/images/that-is-what-mountains-look-like/20161219_150652.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_150652\" width=\"621\" height=\"350\">\nChad has now started a tally of how many times I will kill that car on this trip. So far I am up to 11 times\u2026.but to be fair, I have not had much practice and have recently upgraded to the highway and handling inner city traffic.\n<h3>Garden of the Gods Highlights:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Hardly any people because of cold temperatures (40 degrees)</li>\n \t<li>Seeing the sun was wonderful</li>\n \t<li>Cowgirl boots don\u2019t have traction and make for a hilarious site while walking on snow and rocks</li>\n \t<li>Chad doesn\u2019t appreciate tourist photos as much as the other tourists around him</li>\n \t<li>Chad also noticed a lot of people chilling in their cars on the top of large hill (marijuana dude)</li>\n \t<li>Climbing the rocks was a true challenge</li>\n</ul>\n\nArapahoe Basin Ski Resort was next on the list, but we would be skiing in the morning with the plan to sleep in the resort\u2019s parking lot. It was near dark when we started our 3-hour drive into the mountains and I was thankful Chad was driving for this part of the journey. He loves adrenaline and I enjoy adrenaline spurts, making the curvy mountain roads with tight corners fun for him and nerve-racking for me. We missed most of the beauty as we focused on the icy roads and avoided looking down the deep caverns that hosted small twinkling lights of homes far below. I loved all of the encouraging signs on the side of the road that cheered us along while we skidded around corners: Avalanche Area, Falling Rocks, Icy Before Bridges, 20 MPH Corner and my favorite Avalanche Blasting Area.\n\nI have never been so thrilled to sleep in a stationary car after driving what felt like +12 hours through the mountain slopes. When we could see the mountains during the day we were both astounded by the sheer size and texture that cannot be captured to their fullest by camera. According to Chad, if we had purchased a really nice \u201ctechnical\u201d spotting scope all of our sight-seeing problems would be cured.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/that-is-what-mountains-look-like/20161219_153050.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_153050\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>We aren't smiling for the picture, we are laughing because I just scraped Chad's really nice sunglasses on the rock above me. Chad is laughing off the pain.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<img src=\"/images/that-is-what-mountains-look-like/20161219_145852.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_145852\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><img src=\"/images/that-is-what-mountains-look-like/20161219_145244.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_145244\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">\n\n<img src=\"/images/that-is-what-mountains-look-like/20161219_150101.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_150101\" width=\"442\" height=\"249\"><img src=\"/images/that-is-what-mountains-look-like/20161219_145400.jpg\" alt=\"20161219_145400\" width=\"444\" height=\"250\">Onto the next adventure!",

Look in the distance to the right and you can see the last lift that reaches the tippy top of the mountain.\n<h3>That Morning</h3>\n<img src=\"/images/mountain-slopes-snatchbacks-and-manual-driving/20161220_112448.jpg\" alt=\"20161220_112448\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">The frost on the inside of the car windows gleamed with the lights from the Keystone Ski Resort shining directly in front of the car. Chad and I had made camp in a shadowy parking space of a nearby lodging area for the night and eagerly drove to the Arapahoe Basin Ski Resort just down the road. The mountain was huge, intimidating and loomed around us forming a legit basin where we stood (aka the reason behind the name of the resort). Snowboarder hair flopping in the wind (imagine longer hair slicked back and lightly rippling in the wind for dramatic effect), Chad practically raced me getting our things together and dashed to the rental shop as he was very eager to attack every single run on the mountain. Lord help me*.\n\n \n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/mountain-slopes-snatchbacks-and-manual-driving/20161220_091630.jpg\" alt=\"20161220_091630\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>Not a big mountain? Tricked you, there are more peaks behind this one pictured</figcaption></figure>\n\n*Katie\u2019s skiing background: Maybe have put 30 hours total in my life into skiing and would call my skills \u201cmoderate\u201d.\n\n*Chad\u2019s snowboarding background: snowboarding since around 14 years old, he is familiar with turns, jumps, speed, and varying levels of difficulty. He also volunteers as Ski Patrol at Hyland Ski and Snowboard Resort every year which allows him to practice every other weekend.\n\n<h3>Mountain Skiing Highlights</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The lifts are the coldest part of the entire day</li>\n \t<li>Once at the top of the mountain it\u2019s amazing how far you can see</li>\n \t<li>Chad loves a challenge and helping me learn quickly to make it down the hill alive</li>\n \t<li>Chad also loves to go down black diamonds by mistake and we have no choice but to go down the slope\n<ul>\n \t<li>The first run of the day we rode two sets of lifts to reach the tippy top of the mountain. Chad went first and lead me straight down a mogul filled black diamond by mistake. Yard sales any one?

It didn\u2019t come out that way when I was speaking with Chad as we went around our first one the night before. The reason they are so prominent now is because after skiing we left at 3pm to hit the highway and flee the mountains as soon as possible to avoid driving in them again at night.\n\nExcept this time, I had to drive. Cue the horror movie music before something bad happens. I was terrified as I have re-discovered I am not a huge fan of cliffs or heights let alone slippery roads added into the equation. Chad had to catch up on work and it was unrealistic for him to drive so there was not wiggle room and stalling won\u2019t help.\n<h3>Things to avoid when driving in the mountains</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Avoid the clutch and let the car brake for you while in a lower gear</li>\n \t<li>Listen to the engine for high RPMs and apply brake to lower them</li>\n \t<li>Stay calm and never look over the ledge because the car will stear that way</li>\n \t<li>Don\u2019t apply brakes on the turn, only before to avoid slipping</li>\n \t<li>Having meaningful conversations while focusing is out of the question</li>\n</ul>\n+3 hours later I safely carried us both through the mountains and sped our way to Grand Junction, CO. It would have been really cool to see the caverns we were driving in and to appreciate the huge tunnels that were chiseled out of the side of a cliff face, but the sun sets around 5pm and the dark hinders all beauty.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/mountain-slopes-snatchbacks-and-manual-driving/20161220_124852.jpg\" alt=\"20161220_124852\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"><figcaption>Not happy but petrified to go down the next slope - smiling because it's so scary.

To no avail, we cannot escape the cold weather yet but it has helped us sleep peacefully knowing others cannot peak into our windows. Skipping breakfast, we hit the road heading to Utah with the goal of getting to Las Vegas that evening.\n\nCrossing the Utah border before the sun peaked over the mountains, we stopped at the first rest stop to survey the area. The terrain looks like the terrain from the cowboy movies, what you picture horseback riding to look like in the west and settings for old western towns. The landscape was so different that Colorado and the ground was instantly dry, sandy and hardly holds vegetation.\n\n<img src=\"/images/do-people-actually-live-in-utah/20161221_075249.jpg\" alt=\"20161221_075249\" width=\"384\" height=\"217\">\n\nYes, personal hygiene is important and you can see Chad brushing his teeth as the sun peaks over the distant mountains from Colorado. Chad keeps reminding me that snakes are everywhere, especially in the west.\n\nCan you tell he is not a big fan of snakes? We did see a rabbit but other than that, no wildlife to be seen. If we had a spotting scope, we could see for miles. Chad is still pretty salty about not having this device.\n\nThis day was filled with traveling through rock formations that have been sliced to allow a highway to pass through them and viewing the endless terrain that seems inhabitable from my perspective. Why would anyone want to live in Utah? We never saw any houses or small towns until we were more than half way across the state. Even then the towns were small, sketchy and were places we didn\u2019t want to stay long. Whoever owned the gas stations out here were for sure making a ton of money because their stops would be the only ones for hundreds of miles.\n\nWe stopped occasionally at rest stops to get out and explore the terrain. In one particular location we stopped right before a large range of rock. We later found out it used to be a reef back when there was a large lake covering the west half of the U.S. millions of years ago. We wondered around and I was able to spot fossils everywhere of where used to be coral, cracked mud and a few rocks that had the ribs of fish imprinted on them.\n\nWe used this time to stretch our legs, wander and hike on our own. There is never alone time when traveling in a car or sleeping in the same area and it was nice to have the peace. We met each other on a rock ledge where I found a rock shaped like a heart. I gave this to Chad and laughed. He frowned, looked around and presented me with a rock that looked like a slice of pie. Apparently Chad has given me a symbol of his stomach and we laughed, chucking the rocks down the steep hill we rested on.\n\n<img src=\"/images/do-people-actually-live-in-utah/20161221_095351.jpg\" alt=\"20161221_095351\" width=\"469\" height=\"264\">\n\nHours later, we started to see more small towns proving that people do actually live in Utah. The west side of the state was heavily populated with small (I mean super small) towns dotted along the highway. We headed south toward Zion Nation Park and meant to catch a glimpse of the rock formations before the sun went down.\n\nChad finally killed the car inside the national park and I sure made a big deal about it. Jimmy Johns also makes for great comfort food for Chad. We went for a hike at the very top of a large rock formation that over looked a part of the large red mountain range to the east. The trail was only a mile long to the point but we had chosen the wrong kinds of shoes to climb the mudding red hiking trail. I in the cowgirl boots and Chad is his worn hiking boots had as much traction as a slippery seal. Let\u2019s not fall off the rocky hill, ok?\n\nThe sun went down quickly and we departed to St. George for dinner. We found a more authentic restaurant and ate the first real large meal of the day. Did you know that Utah doesn\u2019t allow drinks to be made in front of the guests and they need to be prepared in a back room out of sight? They also have to get special licenses for dancing at large gatherings (depending on the location). Does Footloose ring a bell? Our waiter laughed and told us that not that far away was the town where that story came from.\n\n<img src=\"/images/do-people-actually-live-in-utah/20161221_144401.jpg\" alt=\"20161221_144401\" width=\"8384\" height=\"1680\">\n\nNeeding some Wi-Fi, we made our way to a caf\u00e9 and I set to work on blogs and Chad to research hotels in Las Vegas. We never planned to hit this city but we found ourselves only a few hours away. Might as well stay in a hotel, see the strip and head out to the Grand Canyon. We made it down into the valley that houses Las Vegas and I made a sarcastic comment about the Trump Tower to our left as we coasted in. Come to find out, our Treasure Island room over looks where we have come in as well as a direct view of the Trump Tower.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/do-people-actually-live-in-utah/20161221_220111.jpg\" alt=\"20161221_220111\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>Trump Tower</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/do-people-actually-live-in-utah/20161221_220103.jpg\" alt=\"20161221_220103\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>Frist view of the city as we drove in</figcaption></figure>\n\nThe city was alive and buzzing but we were tired. A shower and an actual bed was a warm welcome at the end of the day.",

    "content": "<h2>Day 6 Location: Treasure Island Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada</h2>\n<img src=\"/images/it-does-rain-in-las-vegas/20161222_124634.jpg\" alt=\"20161222_124634\" width=\"323\" height=\"575\">We made camp inside a large hotel, yes, a real actual hotel. Safety was a concern and we both were firm about not wanting to camp in the car surrounded by potential crazies. Waking up in Vegas was strange to me. The light-blocking curtains tricked us and we awoke later than we are used to. Neither of us complained, until we had to do laundry.\n\nSo, sleeping in the car mixed in with adventuring outdoor activity will cause clothes to get soiled as well as stink. Duh. We spent the morning enjoying the warm running water, the smell of hotel soap (it actually smelled good), and scrubbing away the dirt we have carried from more than 2 states away. Having purchased Patagonia clothing, the material doesn\u2019t hold water as long as cotton materials and we were able to dry the clothes in only a few short hours. The maids must have thought we were traveling bums, but I guess at this rate we kind of are.\n\n<img src=\"/images/it-does-rain-in-las-vegas/20161222_153917.jpg\" alt=\"20161222_153917\" width=\"162\" height=\"289\">Treasure Island\u2026 (insert tagline tune) was buzzing with people at slot machines, glaring with neon light and loud. Not surprised as I have heard this is one of the cities that never sleeps. Chad and I had meant to walk the strip, being that our hotel was at the very beginning of it, but were stopped due to the light rain that had just started. Looking around, hardly anyone was outside and the water in the streets was high and moving quickly. We went back to retrieve our outer reflective layer and ventured into the rain. We walked the strip heading to our destination, the Caesar\u2019s Hotel Bacchanal Buffet. While scrubbing laundry we had researched the best buffets in Las Vegas and decided to try the $116.78 for two with tax. ;)\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/it-does-rain-in-las-vegas/20161222_132348.jpg\" alt=\"20161222_132348\" width=\"398\" height=\"224\"><figcaption>The entrance and exit hosting raw fish, crab and mussels</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/it-does-rain-in-las-vegas/20161222_151033.jpg\" alt=\"20161222_151033\" width=\"398\" height=\"224\"><figcaption>The view from our table</figcaption></figure>\n\nDressed to the nines in our spare Patagonia, we devoured kisses of the 500 dishes. As we were purchasing our rite of passage, the cashier advice was to take a very small taste of each dish in which she called a \u201ckiss\u201d. I found out quickly that if you speak with the servers, for example a man carving fresh roast beef, and told them you were new to the buffet, it was a mistake. They would smile, make small talk and put a large helping on my plate. I smiled and said thank you, but on the inside I was screaming, \u201cNO!!!!! He is going to make me full!!!!\u201d\n\nChad and I stayed for our limit of 2 hours and had made friends with the server. The server joked about how the staff would watch the people eat until they looked like they would burst and waited patiently to see if anyone would toss their cookies. I almost felt like tossing mine and I was thankful when we left but had to retreat past all of the fried foods. Sneaky trick.\n\nWalking off the food comma, Chad and I explored the strip under a cloud-filled sky and in the rain. We didn\u2019t mind too much since it was around 50 degrees and we could go anywhere without being stuck behind people. Vegas was not what I expected and I waited until night to see the full effect of the neon lights.\n\nAfter asking for suggested places to go from my friends on Facebook, Chad and I watched the volcano show outside The Mirage. We took a bus to Fremont street and bumbled around under the dome of neon lights. There were crazies everywhere mixed in with every kind of person imaginable. Live bands, lights, food, dancing and booths surrounded us. The low energy from our surroundings the entire day was draining and we were happy to hop the bus back to Treasure Island. The bus took us by small chapels that dotted each corner and I continued to make sarcastic jokes about getting hitched. Chad was soooooo amused.\n\nIn the morning, the sun decided to come out a little bit but then quickly retreated. Apparently there was a winter storm coming and we were planning to head right into it. With our destination set, we slowly made our way to the Grand Canyon.\n\nFor those of you wondering, there was no gambling. I was desperate for a bagel with cream cheese I told Chad I would rather spend my money on a bagel and receive it than not at all. Carbs won.",

    "content": "<h2>Day 7 Location: Tip top of Arizona heading towards Flagstaff</h2>\nEating breakfast at Einstein Bros, we then hopped over the custard store on the corner of the strip mall. We devoured the pecan custard as we stretched our legs on a walk around the mall\u2019s stores.\n\nWe took time to wash the dirt and grime off our our noble steed, Royal. The Diesel Jetta came with that name branded to it's rear from an unknown owner of it's past. It's funny because it's not the name of a dealership, someone actually took the time to put the name Royal in chrome letters below the name Jetta on the rear.\n\n<img src=\"/images/attractions-that-could-have-been-done-at-home/20161226_115359.jpg\" alt=\"20161226_115359.jpg\" width=\"444\" height=\"251\">Our day was spent traveling through the mountains and open land of Arizona. We looked out over Lake Mead and wound our way down the huge mountainous slopes. I was driving and Chad was dozing off and on. A few times I pushed his head back against the seat as he was slumped forward resting.\n\n<img src=\"/images/attractions-that-could-have-been-done-at-home/20161223_162524.jpg\" alt=\"20161223_162524\" width=\"392\" height=\"220\">Chad woke right before a sign that read \u201cVisitors Information\u201d and we both agreed to stop. I had pulled off and hung a left down a road towards what I thought was the visitors center. Miles later, we realized that this wasn\u2019t right. Cresting a hill, we entered the Town of Chloride and instantly regretted this decision. There was junk strewn all around on both sides of the street and the road led us to what seemed to be the only intersection in town. A sketchy bar, the sketchiest bar I have ever seen, on the corner read \u201ctourist information\u201d in hand painted letters. Metal cans, barbed wire, and chunks of god-knows-what were strewed across the yard of house directly across from the bar.\n\n<img src=\"/images/attractions-that-could-have-been-done-at-home/20161223_155328.jpg\" alt=\"20161223_155328\" width=\"360\" height=\"203\">I recognized an old white 4-legged washer sitting on the ground surrounded by miss-placed artifacts. Never mind grass, the owner of the labeled \u201cOld Red House\u201d didn\u2019t or had not seemed to care about disposing of any of their trash that laid in the yard. Chad later found out that the town Chloride was a ghost town and was kept up by only a hand full of people. So much for helpful information about the Grand Canyon. I high-tailed it out of there with also another tally added to my engine kills.\n\nThe rain was coming down gently and we made it into Flagstaff, Arizona around dark. Tired and hungry, I was no good at direction and we made a few U-turns on our way to dinner. We ate delicious Thai curry and a noodle dish. It was Christmas eve and there were hardly any people out but this was also due to a \u201cterrible\u201d storm that was about to hit. The waiter said this storm would be one of the worst they have seen in a while. Chad was really itching to use his snow tires and we both weren\u2019t worried by the news.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/attractions-that-could-have-been-done-at-home/20161223_200605.jpg\" alt=\"20161223_200605\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>Note in the upper left corner the small spoon of thai peppers</figcaption></figure>\n\nAfter dinner, we hit a movie. Wow, that\u2019s clich\u00e9. We waited for over an hour in the movie theater until our showing of The Assassins Creed. We stalled by hitting the arcade and only then regretted not gambling a little so that we could have some extra spending cash to put into the Jurassic Park game. By the time we were at our car again, the show had fallen heavily and it was deep. We made camp in a nearby Holiday Inn and Christmas story jokes were made about \u201cnot having room at the Inn\u201d. The snow layer made nice camouflage and we slept soundly unnoticed. Happy Christmas Eve. This was the most uneventful day we have had so far and it didn\u2019t feel as if we were on vacation.",

    "content": "<h2>Day 8 Location: Flagstaff, AZ and the highways to and from the Grand Canyon</h2>\n<img src=\"/images/our-not-so-grand-trip-to-the-grand-canyon/20161224_103859.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_103859\" width=\"402\" height=\"226\"><img src=\"/images/our-not-so-grand-trip-to-the-grand-canyon/20161224_105521.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_105521\" width=\"399\" height=\"710\">The Holiday Inn parking lot glistened with freshly fallen snow. I had finally slept the best I have ever slept in the car whereas Chad had pitiful sleep. We packed up and headed out to find gas and a restroom. Not really hungry but knew we needed energy for our trip to the Grand Canyon, we found a Mexican breakfast restaurant and ordered a pretty awesome enchilada. We walked downtown and peaked into a camping store, an overly priced rock shop and lastly an exclusive Patagonia retail outlet. Practically representatives of the brand, we strode in to check out the articles of clothing not available at other retailers.\n\n<img src=\"/images/our-not-so-grand-trip-to-the-grand-canyon/20161224_103517.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_103517\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">Dressed head to toe in Patagonia, we jived with the cashiers and I tried to find some hiking pants. American thighs and a tiny waist are not what Patagonia tailors to and I was out of luck. Oh well. Chad meanwhile had been keeping to himself and had a troubled look on his face the entire time. Come to find out, he needed to find a restroom and violently relieve himself. Prik Nam Pla traditional Thai spice (diced Thai peppers in fish sauce) from the night before was the culprit and I was glad I had only had a taste whereas Chad had multiple scoops added to his meal. I guess his tolerance for spicy had been lost on this trip of anything but spicy food. (I guess if you don\u2019t use it, you lose it.) Haha.\n\n<img src=\"/images/our-not-so-grand-trip-to-the-grand-canyon/20161224_162008.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_162008\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">Looking alive, Chad began the drive to the Grand Canyon. The snow was coming down and people on the side of the road took advantage of the picturesque landscape. Chad mentioned that he was looking forward to using his Canada rated snow tires and we raced around slow, newly snow experienced drivers.\n\n<img src=\"/images/our-not-so-grand-trip-to-the-grand-canyon/20161224_160647.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_160647\" width=\"498\" height=\"280\">\n\nWe reached the Grand Canyon a few hours later after dodging and weaving sight-seers. Unfortunately, the giant snow storm coming in hindered any view of the canyon and the rangers had said that this storm was one of the larger storms they have had in a long time. They urged travelers to leave as soon as possible. Chad and I jogged along the rim, not being able to see or do anything else while we were there. We were able to have our picture snapped from another tourist as I made jokes about the beautiful vast canyons behind us.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/our-not-so-grand-trip-to-the-grand-canyon/20161224_153959.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_153959\" width=\"9072\" height=\"1776\"><figcaption>Our view of the Grand Canyon</figcaption></figure>\n\nAdrenaline junky Chad raced out of the park going the speed limit as everyone around us was only going around 15 mph. He bobbed and weaved again around cars until we made it to a divide between two major highways. We chose highway 180 due to the lack of cars taking this road and we spun down the freeway in what seemed like average Minnesota weather. To everyone traveling, this was an absolute blizzard. We spun down the road ducking around cars with ease. Bless you Canada rated snow tires. Chad challenged himself as he stooped into the shoulder multiple times to let a plow pass or to dodge around a flailing cars.\n\nWe came upon what looked like a major accident on a rising hill with over 10 cars stopped. After asking the parked car in front of us, we discovered that no one could climb the hill because it was too slippery. Chad hunkered down and slowly made his way passed every single car. I could feel glares and hear the voices inside my head from others cursing us as we passed so easily.\n\n<img src=\"/images/our-not-so-grand-trip-to-the-grand-canyon/20161224_161213.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_161213\" width=\"236\" height=\"420\">We stopped almost halfway up the hill to help a car that had slipped to the right side of the road. Chad attached a tow rope as I reversed the car down the slipper slope to meet his other hook. I instructed the driver of the stuck car on how to maneuver when getting out of snow while being pulled and Chad took his place the Diesel Jetta. Language barriers and unfamiliar to the snowy conditions, the Indian family shook with cold and worry. I heard a baby crying from the back seat as the car lurched free and drove slowly to the left side of the road.\n\nWe helped as much as we could but the whole lot behind us were trapped as they couldn\u2019t climb the slop. They would have to wait for the nearest plow to come, which shouldn\u2019t be too long. Chad resumed climbing the hill and the many more after this. By the end of the trip back to Flagstaff, Chad had successfully shaved off 30 minutes in a snow storm from our travel time that brought us to the Grand Canyon. I was just happy to be alive, warm and well. Serious, these tires are awesome and we didn\u2019t slip once on our 2.5-hour drive.\n\n<img src=\"/images/our-not-so-grand-trip-to-the-grand-canyon/20161224_160612.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_160612\" width=\"388\" height=\"218\">Hardly passed 7pm, Chad and I grabbed Subway for dinner and headed to the movie theater again to watch the new Starwars movie as if the snow storm travel never happened. I was full instantly and saved the sandwich for later while Chad killed it on the Ruben. Come to find out the next morning, if we had gone on the other highway while returning from the Grand Canyon, we would have been stranded as they had closed it due to extremely poor conditions.\n\n<img src=\"/images/our-not-so-grand-trip-to-the-grand-canyon/20161224_161223.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_161223\" width=\"484\" height=\"272\"><img src=\"/images/our-not-so-grand-trip-to-the-grand-canyon/20161224_161257.jpg\" alt=\"20161224_161257\" width=\"486\" height=\"272\">Holiday Inn housed us again that night and it was Christmas Eve. Hunkered down in our sleeping arrangements, we were again shielded by the falling snow.",

    "content": "<h2>Day 9 Location: Flagstaff to Sedona, AZ</h2>\nMan, do I miss having a bathroom right down the hall. The mornings are always hard for me as I am a riser who always, always, always needs to use the bathroom right away. I swear Chad absorbs all of his liquid because he never rushes to leave in the morning. Merry Christmas to me, a full bladder. To my horror, I realized it was Christmas and that means that there will be hardly any places open for me to relieve myself. We drove for what seemed like hours (maybe 20 minutes) until we found a Walgreens that was buzzing with people. THANK GOODNESS.\n\n<img src=\"/images/hiking-in-a-spiritual-place/20161225_111319.jpg\" alt=\"20161225_111319\" width=\"424\" height=\"238\">We tried to find a coffee shop, and with veracity, scoured the city. There was nothing open, and I don\u2019t blame them, so there was no blogging happening this morning. After discussion, we road tripped on to Sedona, AZ. The car wove in and out of mountain caverns and gradually made it down the inclines. The snow from last night\u2019s storm shown bright on the trees and rocks that dotted the mountain sides. We took pictures on road and Chad urged for pristine pictures, especially of a natural branch archway over the top of the road glittered in snow.\n\n<img src=\"/images/hiking-in-a-spiritual-place/20161225_1138090.jpg\" alt=\"20161225_1138090\" width=\"411\" height=\"231\">\n\n<img src=\"/images/hiking-in-a-spiritual-place/20161225_112111.jpg\" alt=\"20161225_112111\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">Sedona popped out of nowhere and we explored the tourist trap by foot. Chit chatted with a map guy, learned where the vortex locations where in the surrounding rock formations and moved on. I stepped into a rock shop and the cashier David invited us in for a long chat. We learned about his world travels and earned a brief synopsis of his life. He shared his love for energy, healing and details about the land. Giving us tips for the hiking, where and where not to eat and advising to try a local yummy we left.\n\nHaving lunch at alien burger joint, we planned our hiking adventure. I tried to get Chad to go to the church built into the rock but the amount of people traveling there and the little parking said otherwise. Chad parked in another church parking lot and we hiked towards Bell Rock. I saw twisted trees caused by the crazy vortex energy. The energy was caused because of the close placement of the iron in the rocks. The information guy explained it like putting two refrigerator magnates together and feeling repletion. A very merry Christmas hike for sure.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hiking-in-a-spiritual-place/20161225_161554.jpg\" alt=\"20161225_161554\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"><figcaption>Hiking towards Baby Bell Rock</figcaption></figure>\n\nIt was truly peaceful as we jogged the trail and climbed the rocks. After the hike we literally restaurant hopped all of the open restaurants in Sedona looking for food. Each one packed with people and the lines out the door. Not finding a place to eat, I settled on my left over Subway sandwich and Chad went to work on finding a place to camp out. Chad, following the suggestions of a mountain bike forum, found places to sleep in the nation parks for free. Upon arrival we were greeted by the welcoming site of car campers strung out in the U-shaped parking lot.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hiking-in-a-spiritual-place/20161225_1616001.jpg\" alt=\"20161225_161600\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"><figcaption>Bell Rock base</figcaption></figure>\n\nSlept. Woke. Then hunted for a coffee shop.\n\n<img src=\"/images/hiking-in-a-spiritual-place/20161225_164809.jpg\" alt=\"20161225_164809\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">",

    "content": "<h2>Day 10 Location: Sedona, Arizona</h2>\nPeople like to group together based on similar interests and we fell head first into a group called Car Campers.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got the hippies, the tree huggers, the city clickers or yuppies, but now I can proudly say that Chad and I have joined a clan or the randos that also like to sleep in their cars.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/car-campers-unite/20161227_082939.jpg\" alt=\"20161227_082939\" width=\"456\" height=\"256\" /><figcaption>Hot air balloons drifted across Sedona in the morning</figcaption></figure>\n\nWe woke to see an assortment of cars and two campers in the U-shaped parking lot.\u00a0 Now in the light, the surrounding areas were the same as the terrain we were hiking the day before at Bell Rock. \u00a0Large bushes, random grass clumps and occasional scrawny trees covered the rolling hills.\u00a0 In the middle of the parking lot there was a modern outhouse (that would have been good to know last night) and our neighbors were just starting to start their engines.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/car-campers-unite/20161227_091109.jpg\" alt=\"20161227_091109\" width=\"448\" height=\"253\" /><figcaption>Example of one of the switch back roads</figcaption></figure>\n\nThe weather is slowly getting warmer as we head south and the windows shine with water droplets instead of ice in the mornings.\u00a0 After wiping off the moisture, Chad and I snuck out of the parking lot.\u00a0 When passing the other cars, we peered into their cars to see what they had done for their sleeping arrangements.\u00a0 We were rewarded with the results and didn\u2019t feel like total outcasts \u00a0for sleeping in the car.\n<h3>How car campers sleep in their car</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Front seat style (Chad and Katie\u2019s style)\n<ol>\n \t<li>Leaning front seats down and resting on the reclined chair huddled in blankets/pillows</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n \t<li>Back seat style\n<ol>\n \t<li>Curling into a fetal position and sprawling out as much as possible on the back seat</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n \t<li>Trunk style\n<ol>\n \t<li>Depending on the car, the owner lays back seats down or has removed them to create a flat sleeping surface. The occupant(s) would then stretch out and sleep with their gear surrounded by blankets/pillows</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\nLater, we found a coffee shop to leech onto their Wi-Fi.\u00a0 A morning of blogging lead to almost a half day of blogging.\u00a0 Everyone and their mother was at the Sedona Starbucks which I assumed was the source of the slow internet\u00a0 Hey-o, dial up ring a bell?\u00a0 Chad and I spent 4 hours struggling with the cursed internet and we finally gave up and tethered his phone to my laptop to use his 4G.\u00a0 We could have had everything we needed to do done in 30 minutes with the speed of the new internet.\u00a0 We were so discouraged by the wasted time, we left to go find food for comfort.\n\nAccording to David from the rock shop, a restaurant called Nick\u2019s had the best corn beef hash he has ever eaten.\u00a0 Chad jumped on this suggestion and we ate it.\u00a0 I do agree with David, it was a pretty good corn beef hash accompanied by homemade hash browns.\n<h3>A car problem</h3>\nOn Christmas Eve we had plowed through a snow storm to get back to Flagstaff, Arizona and Chad treated this drive like an off-road snow race.\u00a0 This is also where he concluded that he burnt out his left head light as they were \u201cworking extra hard\u201d while snow surfing the terrible roads.\n\n<img src=\"/images/car-campers-unite/20161226_1519371.jpg\" alt=\"20161226_151937\" width=\"360\" height=\"202\" />So, in Sedona we searched for an auto shop.\u00a0 Two heads bent over the engine messing with the bulb didn\u2019t seem to help so Chad took over.\u00a0 Apparently, the previous owner of the car had replaced the entire light fixture and put it back in backwards.\u00a0 Chad couldn\u2019t figure out how to extract the bulb and resorted to how-to YouTube videos which helped to realize the backwards structure.\u00a0 Bulb bought and replaced, Chad displayed a hearty egotistical demeanor for what seemed like forever.\u00a0 All in good fun of course and we both mocked each other.\u00a0 Congrats Chad, you changed a bulb haha.\n<h3>Going to the Chapel</h3>\nWith reluctance, I was able to steer Chad towards the Chapel we had skipped the day before.\u00a0 There was even more people there today than the day before and Chad groaned the entire time while looking for a parking spot.\u00a0 His sarcasm and humor is a wonderful addition to anything we attempt and I appreciate the commentary.\u00a0 The chapel was small and unique as it sat on top of a rock structure.\n\n<img src=\"/images/car-campers-unite/20161226_160643.jpg\" alt=\"20161226_160643\" width=\"461\" height=\"259\" />\n\nThere were tons of people weaving in and out of the chapel, but we noticed that no one stayed longer than 5 minutes.\u00a0 Obviously no one is really enjoying the result of their labors as it took over 10 minutes to park and another 10 to climb up the steep hill.\u00a0 Why only spend a short amount of time at your destination when you put so much time into it?\n<h3>Shrimp for dinner</h3>\n<img src=\"/images/car-campers-unite/20161226_195815.jpg\" alt=\"20161226_195815\" width=\"247\" height=\"442\" />Chad and I were tired of going out to eat and our wallets didn\u2019t appreciate the excessive use in Sedona.\u00a0 We walked around downtown, ate a small portion of fudge and walked into other spiritual stores on the strip.\u00a0 Hunger set in and we settled for a grocery store with the intention to find something simple and easy, like vegetables.\u00a0 Instead, we walked out with a bill that would have been the same as going out to eat and a bag of frozen cooked shrimp, 2 cucumbers, cocktail sauce and 2 one-gallon water jugs.\u00a0 So much for not exercising our wallets.\n\nChad used the time in the grocery store to call his family members and I used the car ride sleeping parking lot to catch up with my family.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the shrimp was defrosting on the heated leather seats of the car under my bottom.\u00a0 How else are they going to thaw?\u00a0 The heated body parts of the lower back, thighs and buttocks took shifts to prepare a thawed dinner.\nDinner was served back at our newly discovered campsite while we listened to our audio book, Outlander.\u00a0 The rest of the evening was held in suspense because of the storyline and we stayed up late listening to the story unfold.\u00a0 Who needs TV?",

You are like an invasive species,\" said Chad overly thrilled with the company.</figcaption></figure>\n\nGasping for breath, I woke with a start in the morning. The moisture and CO2 from our breath was trapped in the car with no fresh air to relieve us, causing both Chad and I to breathe deeply from our mouths which eventually woke me abruptly. Cracking a window is a must from now on.\n\nI snuck out to use the bathroom and took the time to go on a small, brisk walk. I looped around the parking lot and wandered down an abandoned driveway to find nothing of interest. I returned to my seat in the car to find Chad sitting straight up and looking at me. I had forgotten to tell him I was going for a walk and he had noticed. Nothing like an early morning wake-up call?\n\nWe hit the road around 8 a.m. and headed to Tucson, Arizona to meet up with Chad\u2019s ski patrol friend and his wife from Minnesota. The Meier\u2019s were escaping the winter cold for a few days to go hiking in the nearby Tucson mountain ranges and we had been invited to join. Why not? But this also meant sleeping in a hotel! Chads protest to civilization was, \u201cwe don\u2019t need showers. People have been going without showers in history.\u201d\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/visiting-a-ghost-town/20161227_085152.jpg\" alt=\"20161227_085152\" width=\"502\" height=\"282\"><figcaption>Climbing the hills to get to Jerome, AZ</figcaption></figure>\n\nDriving across Arizona was nothing like we expected. The northern half was wet, had trees, and even hosted snow. But, the southern half started to become a wasteland of random weed patches, sad looking trees and cacti. Why would anyone want to retire in Arizona? Apparently, this is not Chad\u2019s retirement location with all of the other snow birds.\n<h3>Copper Mine Ghost Town</h3>\n<img src=\"/images/visiting-a-ghost-town/20161227_090911.jpg\" alt=\"20161227_090911\" width=\"422\" height=\"237\">We drove through Jerome, a current ghost town once populated by copper miners and their families, to check it out. Chad\u2019s grandmother was born there and we wanted to see what it was like.\n\nDriving straight up the side of the mountain fingers, we drove switchbacks all the way to where Jerome rested. Chad decided this was a good time to sneeze and I clung for my life as we rounded a corner. Then soon followed with, \u201cmaybe we should stop in the middle of the switchback and brush our teeth.\u201d Oh, so now he wants to focus on personal hygiene. Houses soon appeared and were built into the hills. A once busy place, now empty except for the few who stayed to lure in tourists.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/visiting-a-ghost-town/20161227_090827.jpg\" alt=\"20161227_090827\" width=\"481\" height=\"270\"><figcaption>Housing in Jerome</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/visiting-a-ghost-town/20161227_090540.jpg\" alt=\"20161227_090540\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"><figcaption>Close to main street, the roads are narrow and house small shops</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/visiting-a-ghost-town/20161227_090424.jpg\" alt=\"20161227_090424\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"><figcaption>Row of hotels mixed in with housing</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/visiting-a-ghost-town/20161227_085557.jpg\" alt=\"20161227_085557\" width=\"475\" height=\"267\"><figcaption>View of the town when coming into Jerome</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Arriving in Tucson</h3>\nAfter Chad drove 85 mph down a 7% mountain grade in a 65, we were spit out of the mountains on track for Tucson (flat land!!! Thank god!). Arriving in Tucson, Chad researched hotels and I hunted for dinner. After much needed showers and putting on summer clothes, we had dinner at an Italian restaurant. We were the only ones wearing short sleeves as everyone was wearing sweatshirts, hats and jackets. It was a beautiful 60 degrees and my freckles started to remembered what sun feels like. Hopefully by the end of this trip I will have some color!\n\nHow bad is sugar? Pretty bad. We attacked the Italian meal and stalked down a dessert at another restaurant. We instantly regretted it. Craving sweets, we selected a small eggnog cake and a large piece of mint chocolate chip brownie to eat saddled up to the bar. \u201cOne tall glass of milk, please.\u201d\n\nChasing down the sugar, cinnamon sprinkled cappuccinos topped off our food spree. Retreating to the hotel, Chad and I rested off the food commas by watching Cops on TV. We both realized we haven\u2019t watched TV in the longest time and we were instantly addicted. Cops never seemed so captivating and we reluctantly went to sleep. A long hiking adventure was planned for the next day and I sure needed to prepare for it.",

It is good to be prepared with extra food and water as well as not being afraid to get wet. Chad and I met his friend John and his wife Dana at Sabino Canyon Recreation Center for a hike through the mountains. Upon meeting the Meier\u2019s, I mentally deemed myself the one in the group with the least amount of hiking experience.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hiking-prepared-to-get-wet-in-the-dessert/20161228_0950141.jpg\" alt=\"20161228_095014\" width=\"588\" height=\"331\"><figcaption>Pictured left to right: Dana, John and Chad</figcaption></figure>\n\nBoth John and Dana popped out of their car, slung their dedicated hiking backpacks on their shoulders and they strapped their hiking poles to their packs. Everything that they were wearing from John\u2019s hat to Dana\u2019s hiking shoes told me that this wasn\u2019t their first rodeo and they knew what they were doing. Chad strapped on a back pack filled with water and food. I was only burdened with the clothes on my back and Chad offered to have me carry an empty backpack to help me feel useful. We all laughed and this foreshadowed the group\u2019s humor for the rest of the day.\n\nGetting up close and personal with the cacti, Chad and I marveled at the sheer size of them. Our hike was going to lead us through a ravine that followed a creek. The destination was a giant water fall cascading down from the peaks, but to get there, our group needed to pass over water ways and maneuver through steep switchbacks.\n\nThe views were unreal, the company awesome and the food we packed was delicious. The hike took 4 hours to get to the falls. We crossed over 7 water ways and hopped over rocks while pausing occasionally to rest near the creak or on the path\u2019s rocks. The Meier\u2019s shared their travel stories while we all laughed, joked and swapped memories. I could not have asked for better people to spend an entire day of hiking with.\n\n<img src=\"/images/hiking-prepared-to-get-wet-in-the-dessert/20161228_121846.jpg\" alt=\"20161228_121846\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">\n\n<img src=\"/images/hiking-prepared-to-get-wet-in-the-dessert/20161228_122046.jpg\" alt=\"20161228_122046\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">\n\nOnly 7 short hours later, we arrived back where we started. Not yet wanting to leave, we went on another small looped hike to last another hour. John had asked Chad if he wanted to try a prickly pear cactus, so Chad went to work on trying to get to the fleshy green under the pricks. On cue, Chad pricked himself and danced around shouting while we all laughed. We are truly a supportive bunch.\n\n<h3>Highlights of the day</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>John went swimming in freezing cold water at the falls</li>\n \t<li>Dana hurdled and hopped across the creek rocks like a pro</li>\n \t<li>Chad was able to catch up with John and share stories</li>\n \t<li>I was able to see on foot plants and rocks I have never seen before</li>\n \t<li>The falls was truly a reward and we rested there to have lunch</li>\n \t<li>Sushi boats for dinner never felt or tasted so good after a long day of hiking</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hiking-prepared-to-get-wet-in-the-dessert/20161228_163842.jpg\" alt=\"20161228_163842\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"><figcaption>Our dam picture</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hiking-prepared-to-get-wet-in-the-dessert/20161228_1654261.jpg\" alt=\"20161228_165426\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>Exiting the park as the sun retreats</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hiking-prepared-to-get-wet-in-the-dessert/20161228_1857491.jpg\" alt=\"20161228_185749\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>Well deserved dinner after a long day of burning calories</figcaption></figure>",

    "content": "<h2>Day 13 Location: Tucson, Arizona and San Diego, California</h2>\n<h4>Note for the Reader</h4>\n*For those of you following this adventure, Chad and I have not fallen off the face of the Earth. We also have not frozen to death in the car, veered off the side of a mountain or eloped. There has been a severe shortage of data as well as time to post blog updates. To my attentive readers and family members, I do apologize.\n<h3><img src=\"/images/rush-hour-truly-is-horrible/20161229_092725.jpg\" alt=\"20161229_092725\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">Let\u2019s continue where the adventure left off\u2026</h3>\nThe day after an intense workout is always full of sore muscles, tight ligaments and thoughts of not wanting to do anything unless forced. The hike in the Sabino Canyon from the day before rang out in every step I took as Chad and I went to have breakfast in the hotel lobby. To my horror, I realized we had committed to going on another short hike with John Meier this morning. Oh well, at least I can have a bagel, part of Chad\u2019s waffle and some fruit to stall my thoughts from the exercise.\n\nThis hike wasn\u2019t as crazy as the Sabino waterfall hike but it was still challenging. We met John at his resort where he and his wife stayed. Behind the resort grounds was access to trail heads that trek over the surrounding hills and lead you on miles of desert-like terrain. The Meier\u2019s were heading home to Minnesota today and didn\u2019t have a use for all of the food/water they had accumulated for their hiking trips. Happy late Christmas to us! Yay, food! We appreciated their kindness and company while in Tucson, AZ.\n\n<img src=\"/images/rush-hour-truly-is-horrible/20161229_095121.jpg\" alt=\"20161229_095121\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><img src=\"/images/rush-hour-truly-is-horrible/20161229_095131.jpg\" alt=\"20161229_095131\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">Chad, John and I spent the morning hours wandering through what I originally thought Arizona would look like. There were chunks of rock here, sand there, giant looming cacti spotting the desert-like hills and black birds circling in the sky. Way to go Hollywood, you finally nailed a truthful reality.\n\nOur hiking time quickly flew by and it was already time to depart with the John and Dana. Their resort entry had flavor infused water so we all quenched our thirst before hitting the road. Chad handed me a cup of water he had already filled and I took a big gulp of it. Fire sloshed inside my mouth and quickly burned all the way to my stomach as I swallowed. Everyone grinned because the water Chad had given me was jalapeno infused water and it sure packed a punch.\n\n<img src=\"/images/rush-hour-truly-is-horrible/20161229_102300.jpg\" alt=\"20161229_102300\" width=\"465\" height=\"261\">\n\n*Side note- Chad enjoys giving his pallet spices from all cultures, especially the extremely spicy ones. I should know by now that all of his food is laced with ranges of spice but I didn\u2019t think I had to watch out for water!\n<h3>Blink and you miss it</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"/images/rush-hour-truly-is-horrible/20161229_124231.jpg\" alt=\"20161229_124231\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2984\"><figcaption>Landscape scattered with sad bushes</figcaption></figure>\n\nTo be honest, I can\u2019t remember much of the drive from Tucson, Arizona to San Diego because the terrain was pretty bland. There was hardly any living greenery due to desert-like conditions, and if there were, the terrian was dotted with the sad looking bushes. We had been accustomed to rock formations throughout the drive so none of the landscape we passed was truly thrilling.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/rush-hour-truly-is-horrible/20161229_122511.jpg\" alt=\"20161229_122511\" width=\"495\" height=\"278\"><figcaption>This is an example of a sad bush</figcaption></figure>\n\nLooking back at the images, the shots are indeed unique and thrilling but at the time we both were saying, \"Oooooh another mountain. What a shocker.\" As for blinking and missing anything exciting while driving to CA, there are a few fun things we did see.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Border patrol signs\n<ul>\n \t<li>This also lead to the \u201cNo Hitchhiking\u201d signs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Random barbed wire fences</li>\n \t<li>Huge rock outcroppings towards CA\n<ul>\n \t<li>They turned out to be mountains\u2026drat</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Miles of pistachio trees in their designated orchards</li>\n \t<li>Plots of solar panels that stretched as far as the eye could see</li>\n \t<li>Dirt. Red to be specific.</li>\n \t<li>Matching the solar panels, giant windmills were planted at the foot of the mountains</li>\n \t<li>Sand dunes!!!!</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"/images/rush-hour-truly-is-horrible/20161229_142412.jpg\" alt=\"20161229_142412\" width=\"552\" height=\"310\">\n\n<h3>San Diego: A city filled with bad traffic, no parking spaces and crazy drivers</h3>\nPlummeting down the side of the mountains, Chad and I shot into San Diego just after sun set. The city was dark but there were lights everywhere from the traffic, residential homes and shopping centers. To our horror, it was around 5:30pm which explained the stand-still traffic on both sides of the highway. That\u2019s a total of 8 lanes and no one was moving! Unbelievable. I knew traffic was bad in California but I didn\u2019t actually believe it was that bad. We got off at the nearest exit but had to wait 30 minutes to get there (it was less than half a mile away!). This was not a city to park the car and sleep in, especially now that there is no snow/ice to block the windows. Chad remembered he had a friend, AJ, who lived here and called him up. We scored a pull-out couch to crash on as well as information about everything there is to do in San Diego.\n\n<img src=\"/images/rush-hour-truly-is-horrible/20161229_162226.jpg\" alt=\"20161229_162226\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">After hiking that morning and driving 7 hours, we were so beat. AJ was also incredibly tired as he had just stepped off a plane returning from family in Minnesota when Chad called. We sure were a sorry bunch. AJ wanted to help our hungry stomachs and suggested we walk to North Park to get some awesome street tacos.\n\nBut, first we had to find parking in AJ\u2019s neighborhood. Bah, what a joke. We drove around for at least 20 minutes, if not more, to park blocks away from Aj\u2019s apartment. Apparently, parking is so terrible that when Aj comes home from work he sometimes has to sit in the middle of the street with his truck for over an hour waiting for someone to leave their parking space.\n\n<img src=\"/images/rush-hour-truly-is-horrible/20161229_192058.jpg\" alt=\"20161229_192058\" width=\"529\" height=\"297\">\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/rush-hour-truly-is-horrible/20161229_192218.jpg\" alt=\"20161229_192218\" width=\"248\" height=\"444\"><figcaption>Our host AJ and Chad picking out tacos for dinner</figcaption></figure>\n\nThe tacos were bomb and North Park was equitable to what Minneapolis\u2019s Uptown resembles. According to Chad, North Park is a way nicer version of Uptown. Back at the apartment, Chad and AJ caught up while I practically dozed sitting upright. It was also lightly raining outside, which apparently never happens. Chad and I never cease to get all of the wacky weather on this trip.\n\nTomorrow would be the ocean, beaching, swimming, zooing, walking, eating and sightseeing. Fully stretched out on the bed, my lower back protested and rioted because it wasn\u2019t reclined in the leather seats of the car. Too bad back! Yes, this also means both Chad and I earned showers by crashing at AJ\u2019s apartment. Woot, woot!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/rush-hour-truly-is-horrible/20161230_080945.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_080945\" width=\"489\" height=\"275\"><figcaption>Chad passed out</figcaption></figure>",

    "content": "<h2>Day 14 Location: San Diego, California</h2>\n<img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_093833.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_093833\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">California: the land of sun, current drought, high fire danger, and traffic jams. Apparently, the draught decided to end for a few days as we woke up to the gentle sound of rain. There was absolutely no one out on the streets and the traffic was what I consider an average day in Minnesota.\n\nChad and I are foodies and we like to have the best meal we can possibly get while in each place we visit. According to Chad, I have been deemed the Navigator and it is my job to find these awesome locations. But, since my mind does not think like Chad\u2019s, none of the results I produce are up to his standards. It also doesn\u2019t help that Chad never voices his thoughts and magically assumes I know what he is thinking. No Chad, my gift isn\u2019t telepathy. To make matters worse, it was Saturday. Apparently on Saturdays, Chad falls into a sour mood and claims that this is his worst day of the week. Sundays are better days and his mood will become happier again. This is what I get for traveling in close quarters with someone; you get to know everything about them.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_101828.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_101828\" width=\"573\" height=\"322\"><figcaption>Navigator's choice: Truckstop</figcaption></figure>\n\nAfter multiple minutes of frustration and not finding a place online with \u2018amazing\u2019 reviews, we settled on a place to eat close to the ocean in Pacific Beach, Truckstop. If a waffle smothered in sugary goodness didn\u2019t cheer him up, it was going to be a long day. And it was.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_105451.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_105451\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>One of the first views of the Ocean on the west coast</figcaption></figure>\n\nFueled on sugar, I was more than ready to see the ocean. I grabbed Chad\u2019s arm and skipped all the way to the boardwalk. Well, it was me skipping and Chad forcefully restraining from the skipping motion.\n\n \n\nThe ocean was wonderful and everything I imaged it would be. There was an ice cream shack sporting a mural of painted fish and a giant shark where people could take pictures. The shops on the strip haven\u2019t opened and there were only a few people on the beach. But, if you weren\u2019t careful a jogger will knock you down when walking across the boardwalk.\n\nIt was a little chilly but still warmer than Minnesota, so I shook off my cowgirl boots, rolled up my black running tights and threw off the socks to go play in the water. Grumpy Chad hung back and calmly took in the crashing waves. It was partly cloudy with an occasional beam of sun glinting across the water. To break Chad\u2019s mood, I tried to cheer him up with a romantic kiss on the beach.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_111007.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_111007\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"><figcaption>Naruto run for my friend Anneka to appreciate</figcaption></figure>\n\nHe didn\u2019t think this was very funny. Seeing this action wasn\u2019t appreciated, I made it my goal for the day to be a cheesy romantic to bother him even more. If he was going to be a sour puss, I might as well make him as miserable as possible with my annoying actions and eventually he would have to perk up. Ha, what logic that was. Way to go Katie.\n\n \n\n<img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_122944.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_122944\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_110116.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_110116\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"><figcaption>Enter some funny comment about me looking like Merida from the Disney movie Brave.</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Surfs up dude</h3>\nChad was fascinated with the surfers resting on their boards in the water. He watched from the beach for the longest time and said we couldn\u2019t leave until he saw a really good ride. There must have been a newbie surfer in our view because he would fall just after standing up on the wave. We were going to be there forever if that one surfer determined our day\u2019s events.\n\n<img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_122956.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_122956\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\">\n\nCoaxing Chad as if he were a stubborn ox, I lead him up the board walk out onto the giant pier. Big mistake. I thought the pier would allow us to see the massive waves up-close, and it did, but it also exposed the other side of the ocean. This side hosted black dots of surfers for as long as the eye could see and the surfers were at all different skill levels.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_1222571.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_122257\" width=\"265\" height=\"353\"><figcaption>Crabby Chad captured while over looking his surfers</figcaption></figure>\n\n\u201cI just want to see one good run,\u201d said Chad, with his head in his hands and elbows resting on the old wood pier. I left him there and continued on my own adventure to the end of the pier and caught sight of a tamed pelican sitting on a wood pillar.\n\n \n\nThere were people of all colors, backgrounds and locations mingling around me. I loved the diversity and would purposefully position myself next to different groups of people to over hear their accents or stories they were sharing.\n\nI was just starting to create scenarios for some of the families (ex. Where they had come from, where they were going, what the kid with the sucker in his mouth was complaining about\u2026) and Chad wandered over. Really Chad, now you are ready? The rest of the morning at the ocean was filled with occasional teasing, silence and taking in the beautiful force of the crashing waves.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_122248.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_122248\" width=\"591\" height=\"333\"><figcaption>Chad evaluating the surfer talent. Black dots in water are surfers.</figcaption></figure>\n\n \n<h3>Zoooooooooo</h3>\n<img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_161636.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_161636\" width=\"552\" height=\"310\">\n\nApparently, the San Diego Zoo is the zoo to go to. Uh huh, and if the more expensive something is the more value it holds. We paid $50 some dollars per ticket (the cheapest deal) to go to the zoo. Chad and I (more me than Chad) were going to see every gosh darn thing this zoo had to offer. Semi sober from being grumpy, Chad was uber thrilled to go to a place where there would be a ton of people (not).\n\n<img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_155837.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_155837\" width=\"443\" height=\"249\">\n\nThe crummy, no sun weather was turning out to be working in our favor because the zoo was hardly busy according to a lady I spoke with while Chad used the restroom. She was there the day before when the weather was nice and she said the zoo was buzzing with people. Today, she said, was very slow and there were hardly any people. This excited me because then Chad wouldn\u2019t be as frustrated and I could enjoy quickly moving from exhibit to exhibit without dodging small children or strollers.\n\n<img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_145441.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_145441\" width=\"537\" height=\"302\">To our horror once getting inside the gates, there were people everywhere rushing around and giant double decker tour buses cruising by with loud speakers describing the park to the passengers. So much for a \u201cslow\u201d day. I couldn\u2019t image a busy day at this zoo. Maybe a busy day at the San Diego Zoo could be relatable to a normal day at the Minnesota State Fair with walls of people traveling the isles between the animal exhibits. Ew.\n\n \n\nOur zoo ticket came with a ride on the bus, so we hopped on right away and zoomed around the entire zoo. Our driver explained facts about the animals we passed, gave us the history of when the animals joined the zoo and told us about eating habits. This tour was helpful because we got to see everything in the zoo, learned the behind the scenes care for specific species and more about the purposes of the park.\n\nMy favorite part of the zoo was the rainforest because we were able to walk through a path that hosted many varieties of plants which eventually lead to a giant bird cage. Having driven through a lot of land that does not have very many green trees or water, I was reminded Minnesota. Oh, seeing the rhinos and the hippos were pretty great too.\n\n<img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_153038.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_153038\" width=\"573\" height=\"322\">\n\nChad is a super fan of reptiles, especially snakes (not). We ventured to the reptile house and examined all of the different species of snakes, frogs and salamanders. Some of those suckers were pretty big and I wouldn\u2019t want to run into them either. Having the glass between life and death was comforting. We both agreed that we didn\u2019t want to come across these specimens anywhere else.\n\n<h3>Rain Rain Rain</h3>\nDinner was supposed to be outdoors under cabanas at a Mexican restaurant in the very old, original part of San Diego, Old Town, with Chad\u2019s friend AJ, AJ\u2019s sister and their four friends. The rain sprinkled at first when we arrived and the place was packed. The waiters, dressed in old Spanish style suits, were running around opening canopies and the waitresses, dressed in old style Spanish dresses with lace, delivered food as fast as they could.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_182314.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_182314\" width=\"545\" height=\"306\"><figcaption>The enterance to the restaurant</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/saturday-is-not-chads-best-day/20161230_182209.jpg\" alt=\"20161230_182209\" width=\"546\" height=\"308\"><figcaption>Outdoor stage right next to the restaurant about to put on a play</figcaption></figure>\n\nWe all filled up on chips and salsa while waiting for our server to return to take our orders. Most of us settled for appetizers for our meals and we left waddling out to the parking lot. It was practically pouring by now and I was thankful we ate indoors. The brave souls who still ate at their outside tables seemed drenched and very chilled. Welcome to San Diego, a wet beach town.\n\nChad\u2019s mood did cheer up and it was really nice to be in a location for an entire day without driving. While being constantly around someone and having no breaks, it was nice to have quiet time when visiting the beach or while walking around exploring. The trip so far has hosted very little disagreements, no arguments to speak of and it seems like we are enjoying each other\u2019s company.",

    "content": "<h2>Day 15 location: North Park, San Diego and Riding Highway 101</h2>\n<h3>Always Take the Scenic Route</h3>\n<img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_0949281.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_094928\" width=\"529\" height=\"297\">\n\n\u201cGood morning San Diego, this is the weather speaking. Expect rain, cold wind and partly cloudy skies for the remainder of the day.\u201d\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_144133.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_144133\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>Driving, Driving, Driving</figcaption></figure>\n\nChad and I left Aj\u2019s in the morning around 9:30am to go find breakfast in North Park. We did not want to give up our precious parking spot so we walked downtown to go have an amazing breakfast that was suggested the night before. To our amazement, all of the shops/restaurants, except for the yoga studio, were closed until 10am. Who was going to feed us?!\n\nFrustrated and annoyed with the menus of the nearby food places, we trudged back the way we came and hopped in the car. Hungry and crabby, we both circled the blocks hunting for food but gave up. We high-tailed it out of there and traveled north to start making out way back home. This is where reality began sinking in; the trip would be ending in less than a week. But, a week is usually an average vacation time so we still had time to enjoy the journey a little longer.\n\n<img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_121103.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_121103\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">Highway 5 became home for the rest of the day and we stopped randomly to eat, stretch our legs and use the bathroom. Breakfast was an exasperated attempt and we gave up to eat in a town called Encinitas. The sky was dark grey and begging to pour any minute. Chad and I both agreed that San Diego wasn\u2019t as amazing as we thought it was going to be. It was busy, crowded and a hassle. It may have been different if we researched areas to spend time in, but we didn\u2019t. While walking around Encinitas, in our opinion, this town was worthy of living in.\n\nThe neighborhood streets ended with steep cliffs eroding into the ocean and Chad was drawn to the sound of the waves. These waves were massive and had no mercy on the rocky cliffs. We spent countless minutes taking in the noise of the waves, the smell of the salt, the feel of the wind on our faces and the remaining taste of breakfast on our tongues.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_123946.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_123946\" width=\"506\" height=\"285\"><figcaption>Random orange tree on the street</figcaption></figure>\n\nPeople also looking for a view of the ocean would join us at the railing, look for less than 5 minutes and turn to leave. Are they not ever satisfied when they finally see or get what they want? Must they always be looking immediately for something else and not take time to smell the flowers? This idea of taking in the beauty, resting and being still has been the occurring theme of our vacation. I am thankful for the peace we have decided to create.\n\nChad and I made our way to another dead end that rested in a nice looking neighborhood. The path way led into a garden and overlooked the ocean. I curled up on a bench while Chad overlooked the waves. Thinking I would only rest my eyes, I actually fell asleep for at least 30 minutes. I woke up startled, not knowing where I was and was very relieved that Chad was sitting on the next bench over. It never occurred to me until that moment that he could have just left me there to sleep and went on his merry way. Thank you Chad for not leaving me in a random state so far from home!\n\nNot long after waking up, a lady came up the path and starred at the ocean with coffee in hand. We made jokes with her about morning coffee and the ocean waves which lead to a brief conversation with her. As she was describing her story about choosing this town for retirement, she looked over and pointed across the waves. A large black object rose out of the waves then a giant whale tale flipped out of the water. In bewilderment, we all stared out to see if it would pop out of the water again, but it kept on its course. The local told us that it\u2019s rare for us to see the orcas and we spotted one!\n\n<img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_131623.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_131623\" width=\"571\" height=\"321\">\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_135820.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_135820\" width=\"378\" height=\"673\"><figcaption>\"I'm whaley wet from the rain.\"</figcaption></figure>\n\n\u201cHow long have you guys been together?\u201d came the random question from the local lady. Chad and I looked at each other and laughed. We responded and gave a little back ground as to what we were up to with the 3-week road trip. Her eyebrows shot up in surprise and told us, \u201cif you can go on a road trip with each other and sleep in the car, you guys are good to go.\u201d Then begins to hum the wedding bells chorus, \u201cdum dum dum dum, dum dum dum dum.\u201d\nWe all burst out laughing and she started to retreat to her waiting husband in the car. She then smirked, laughed and said that this garden is a great place to become engaged. \u201cWith the ocean in the background, it\u2019s perfect!\u201d\n\n\u201cEw, ew, ew,\u201d said Chad as she left and we both laughed the encounter off. No engagements today if we could help it!\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Huntington Beach Caves</h3>\nStopping for coffee and treats at Starbucks in a random town, I joked with the cashier about not knowing where we were. She was almost appalled that I didn\u2019t know I was in Huntington Beach. Well fine, let\u2019s go find this beach!\n\nChad found the beach and made sure he let me know that HE had found it. This is because Chad always has great ideas and they have a high percentage of actually working out. He wanted to just look at it. Screw that, I wanted to touch the ocean and feel the sand. I raced down the steep slope and was amazed with what I found at the bottom.\n\nImagine a sappy romance novel set in a beach town where the couples sneak off to the beach caves in the dead of night. I found the caves! This was the first time coming into contact with rough rocks and cliffs where I could explore the caves below. Begging Chad to come explore with he, he shook his head vigorously nooooooooo as he did not want any chance of recreating any beginnings of a romance novel. Fine, suit yourself! I went on to explore without him and he kept his distance to view the ocean.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_153440.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_153440\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>I would like to point out the cacti on the beach</figcaption></figure>\n\nI discovered small tide pools that hosted sea anemones that I played with using a stick to make them close their flailing arms. They were all over the rocks in and out of the water, obviously waiting for the tide to come in to open up again. The waves were crashing into the rocks and there was a fear of getting completely soaked without warning.\n<h3><img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_154001.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_154001\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"></h3>\n\n \n\n<img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_153307.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_153307\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">\n<h3>A not so happy New Year</h3>\n<img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_163641.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_163641\" width=\"519\" height=\"292\">\n\nSkirting around Los Angeles, I hunted down a sea food dinner in Santa Monica. We went to the Water Grill and we skipped the reservation by claiming spots at the bar. We had a small feast of raw delicacies like oysters, crab, snails, and mussels with a bowl of clam chowder. It was great to have the fresh sea food but the quantity was not very filling for $70. I can check that off having fresh seafood by the ocean off my bucket list.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_153950.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_153950\" width=\"559\" height=\"314\"><figcaption>View from inside the beach caves</figcaption></figure>\n\nIt was time to look for places to sleep and we didn\u2019t want to be in city limits for safety reasons. While walking back to the car after dinner, we could see a pier reaching into the water decked with flashing lights of an amusement park. The streets were scattered with people looking for New Year\u2019s dinner and strange figures resting in the dark for the night.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_162611.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_162611\" width=\"516\" height=\"290\"><figcaption>We drove by a Ferrari dealership and had to take a peak</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_162808.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_162808\" width=\"518\" height=\"291\"><figcaption>There they are!</figcaption></figure>\n\nWe walked by a few benches and Chad said he found my place to sleep for the night, the bench. Clinging to his arm, I talked about being a leech and not letting go. He didn\u2019t like this at all, you know because public affection is basically a sin with him, and I let go on the condition of me still being allowed to join him on this trip. I\u2019m still waiting for the incident where one of us will be hopping a flight back to Minnesota while the other drives because we can\u2019t stand being around each other anymore.\n\nSearching for places to sleep yielded very few safe sleeping locations and we headed out of town to drive as far as we could. Being the Navigator, I was in charge of finding a sleeping place. I had a hotel parking lot lined up and when we got there, the hotel had hired parking lot guards. Obviously this was not going to work and it also told us that this neighborhood where ever we were was not sleeping worthy. This mistake cost us an hour of drive time but I was able to use a restroom in a fast food burger joint. Yippee.\n\n<img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_154110.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_154110\" width=\"536\" height=\"301\">\n\nGetting back into the car, fireworks were lit off and this signaled the new year. Two tired, crabby people stared at each other in the car and we shrugged. Here\u2019s to starting the new year in a random town in California, exhausted, still hungry from lack of dinner food and nowhere near a camping place for the night. At least we were still on talking terms, but barely since I miss calculated sleeping arrangements.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_153816.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_153816\" width=\"538\" height=\"303\"><figcaption>Giant homes on the beach</figcaption></figure>\n\nThe early morning ended at a truck stop around 2am and we went through the motions of getting ready for bed. What an exhausting day and to think it was a holiday. We car camped with 3 other car neighbors and didn\u2019t stay up later than we needed to. All this driving was starting to wear on our bodies and we were beginning to always be tired.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/not-a-typical-new-year-celebration/20161231_155102.jpg\" alt=\"20161231_155102\" width=\"587\" height=\"330\"><figcaption>Had to take a picture pretending to be the Little Mermaid</figcaption></figure>\n\nWe ended the night all nestled into our sleeping bags and recounted the day\u2019s events, laughing at the random stranger at the ocean overlook, the whales, the stretches of beaches and the mishap with the sleeping spot. We were able to laugh it off and rested deeply until almost 10am. It wasn\u2019t the typical New Year celebration, but we were still on talking terms so I didn\u2019t complain one bit!",

    "content": "<h2>Day 16 Location: San Francisco and Fort Bragg, California</h2>\n<h3>Blurred world</h3>\nSleeping in without a set alarm, we both woke up late after last night\u2019s long hours on the road.\u00a0 When taking off a sleeping mask always, always, always take it off under the blankets or put your face into something to help your eyes adjust to the light.\u00a0 I forgot about this and ripped off my mask and was instantly blinded by the brightest light I have ever seen.\n\nIt could be described as a white light that caused instant, very intense pain.\u00a0 My vision for the next 5 hours was blurred and I couldn\u2019t see near or far.\u00a0 Nothing was coming into focus and I couldn\u2019t even see Chad\u2019s face while he sat in the driver\u2019s seat next to me.\u00a0 For having 20/20 vision on the daily, this was terrifying.\n\nDecked out in sunglasses. I went into the gas station to clean up and had to rely on all of my other senses to make sure I used the correct bathroom.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t believe my vision was that bad.\n\nChad obviously had to drive and we spend the morning driving through groves of trees, hills and cattle pastures.\u00a0 Chad had to describe them to me of course because I couldn\u2019t make out any of the details except for the shapes.\u00a0 Huge orange groves or other nut trees were everywhere for miles.\u00a0 The day before had oil pumps dotting the landscape, with large oil tankers resting in the bay along the coast.\u00a0 What a drastic change in scenery.\u00a0 California was sure throwing us a few curve balls.\n\nBrunch time came around and we hopped out of the car for gas, ate a sad burger and I finished off the frozen yogurt.\u00a0 Chad thought my eyes looked extremely dry and we picked up eye drops.\u00a0 With multiple treatments throughout the day, my sight was restored.\u00a0 Weird.\n<h3>Sweet and Sour Chicken Craze</h3>\nSan Francisco was our destination for lunch and I had less than 10 minutes to decide where we were going to eat.\u00a0 We paid for the bridge (we didn\u2019t expect that) and drove into the impressive skyline.\u00a0 There were tons of cars all going the same way and realized that the bridge was a double-decker.\u00a0 There were cars leaving the city under us on another ramp.\u00a0 We would have to come back and visit for sure, there was not enough time to spend in this city this time.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/san-fran-is-the-place-to-be/20170101_134244.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_134244\" width=\"573\" height=\"322\" /><figcaption>Waiting to pay to cross the bridge</figcaption></figure>\n\n<img src=\"/images/san-fran-is-the-place-to-be/20170101_134115.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_134115\" width=\"574\" height=\"322\" />\n\nThe reviews of a restaurant said we were going to eat the best Reuben ever, but when we got to the shop it was closed because of New Year\u2019s Day.\u00a0 We walked the strip of the section we were in looking for other food.\u00a0 I loved the architecture and watching the chaos of buses, people and listening to all of the new city sounds.\u00a0 There was a sign for Chinese food in front of a shop and it looked delicious!\u00a0 Chad thought it was going to be lame American Chinese food; we were wrong.\u00a0 This was literally the best Chinese food I have ever eaten.\n\n<img src=\"/images/san-fran-is-the-place-to-be/20170101_153936.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_153936\" width=\"589\" height=\"331\" />\n\nYou the food is authentic when the only people in the restaurant are the people who come from that culture.\u00a0 We hit the jack pot.\u00a0 Ugh, ever since that meal I am extremely disappointed with any of the sweet and sour chicken I try.\u00a0 This chicken we had in San Francisco was crunchy, had an obvious homemade orange chicken sauce and left a zing of citrus in your mouth.\u00a0 Thank you Tai Chi Restaurant!\u00a0 We highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area.\n\n<h3>Cliff Sleeping</h3>\nUsing the freecampsites.net website, we had found a free area to sleep that was apparently right on an ocean cliff next to Fort Bragg.\u00a0 From San Francisco, the drive was about 3.5 hours and we left the city as the sun was going down.\u00a0 To get to Fort Bragg, we traveled the scenic route for a little way on Highway 1 but once it was dark, we hopped onto Highway 101.\u00a0 This saved us at least two hours of driving.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t see much of what we were passing so we paid more attention to our audio book.\u00a0 As of now, we have finished the first Outlander book and had eagerly started the second book, Dragon Fly in Amber.\u00a0 For those of you who want to know, the audio book length for Outlander is 32 hours and 43 minutes.\u00a0 Chad and I have listened to every single word on that book so that means we have been driving in the car for a minimum of the book length.\n\n<img src=\"/images/san-fran-is-the-place-to-be/20170101_140015.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_140015\" width=\"548\" height=\"308\" />\n\nWe didn\u2019t have the book playing the entire time while driving into different states, but it\u2019s still crazy to think that we sat and listened to over 32 hours of one book.\u00a0 Now hooked on the story line, we began the second without a blink of an eye.\u00a0 This book is 38 hours and 58 minutes long.\u00a0 Our goal was to finish the book before we were home in Minnesota.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/san-fran-is-the-place-to-be/20170101_140050.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_140050\" width=\"465\" height=\"261\" /><figcaption>This is very impressive parking</figcaption></figure>\n\nThe sharp winding roads had led us through flat land which transitioned into thick, tall pine trees.\u00a0 The rain had finally broken and it was pouring the majority of the way to the campsite.\u00a0 While the temperature hovered around 33 and 32 degrees, Chad navigated through the slick turns, trying not to launch us off into the dark.\u00a0 Our high beams were starting to catch glimpses of massive tree trunks and we realized the road was designed to move around them.\u00a0 We were getting into red wood forest territory and I couldn\u2019t wait to see the giant trees in the daylight.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/san-fran-is-the-place-to-be/20170101_142245.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_142245\" width=\"587\" height=\"330\" /><figcaption>A hot mess of train wires littered the sky</figcaption></figure>\n\nWe arrived at our location just before midnight and we settled into the best camping spot ever.\u00a0 The rain had slowed to a cold drizzle and we could hear the angry waves crashing as we shut off the car.\u00a0 It was very dark and looking out the windows we could see thousands of stars because there was no light pollution emanating from the large cities.\n\nI am not afraid of heights, but I am very afraid of falling.\u00a0 I stayed in the car while Chad went investigate our new lawn and cliff in the front of our mobile car-house. \u00a0The black figure carried his flashlight only 15 yards away from the car, paused, and I saw the bobbing light returning quickly to the car.\u00a0 Chad doesn\u2019t get nervous often and he expressed that he was not going to explore this cliff in the dark because it was a sheer drop off.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad I stayed in the car.\n\nThe large moon shone light onto the rocks and giant waves in front of us and we couldn\u2019t wait to see the surrounding area in the sunlight.\u00a0 By this time, it has been more than 2 weeks since we left home and we had only stayed in a few places with a roof over our heads.\n\n<img src=\"/images/san-fran-is-the-place-to-be/20170101_155108.jpg\" alt=\"20170101_155108\" width=\"125\" height=\"223\" />\n\n*Please take note of how long Chad's beard is getting*\n\nThere has never been a large disagreement, negative energy or situations where it was impossible to be around each other.\u00a0 I\u2019m thankful I picked a good road trip buddy because otherwise this would have been unbearable.\u00a0 The only downside I can think of would be me taking on some of Chad\u2019s mannerisms, which I catch myself doing and scold myself.\u00a0 There will be no conforming on any trip!",

    "content": "<h2>Day 17 Location: Northern California, the Redwood Forest</h2>\nThe night before we had parked our car on the edge of a cliff, not knowing what was below. In the morning light, our view from inside the car was still obstructed from the moisture clinging to the windows. As soon as we cleared them, the view was breath taking. I\u2019ll let the pictures do the talking.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_081704.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_081704\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>View from my side of the car</figcaption></figure>\n\n<img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_081818.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_081818\" width=\"10496\" height=\"1600\">\n\nNot wanting to leave, we back tracked to the nearest town to grab a bite to eat then quickly turn around to continue driving north to see the Redwood forest. As we were driving back past our cliff camping spot, someone was parked in the lot taking pictures. We had avoided the tourists!\n\n<img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_081732.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_081732\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\">\n\nThe road immediately took us into the surrounding hills and popped us back to the ocean side often. The roads we were driving on last night held many treasures that would could now see in the day light. We had been passing through thick forests of the largest trees I will ever see in my life. Dotted here and there, these ginormous trees loomed above us to cover the road in archways with their branches. Some trees even caused the road to quick turn to go around the trunks.\n\nThis post will be mainly pictures because there are so many cool shots I want to share. We never went to the National Redwood Forest because the trees were everywhere along the highway and we found ourselves in places where there weren\u2019t a lot of people.\n\n<img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_103149.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_103149\" width=\"552\" height=\"310\">\n\nThe weather was terrible. When I say terrible, we literally had every kind of weather you can image happen to us on this day. Sunny, cloudy, windy, not windy, cold, hot, rain, sleet and snow. I joked about what can happen next and it instantly started hailing. WHAT?!\n\nThe roads we traveled led us through small towns and tourist traps. But, one in particular was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to drive through a tree and we did precisely that. I couldn\u2019t see anywhere near the top of the tree and the branches grew out, turned directly 90 degrees and continued growing upward. The thickness of this \u2018branch\u2019 was exactly the size of a full grown tree. How in the word does this tree support all of the weight!?\n\n<img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_120131.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_120131\" width=\"2984\" height=\"5312\">\n\n<img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_114452.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_114452\" width=\"443\" height=\"787\">\n\nChad and I detoured through the Avenue of the Giants, saying that this would suffice for not going into the actual Redwood Forest. The trees are nothing special, they look like any other regular tall pine tree you would see up north. But the sheer size of the average tree trunk was bigger than the length of our Diesel Jetta.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_114544.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_114544\" width=\"502\" height=\"898\"><figcaption>Do you see Chad?</figcaption></figure>\n\nI convinced Chad to park a few times to get out and explore at the base of the trees. One particular time we traveled further than the designated tourist area to explore away from the road.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_114657.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_114657\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>Can you see the chared bark from previous forest fires?</figcaption></figure>\n\nAccording to pamphlet I grabbed at the beginning of the Avenue, this area had never been logged or touched by humans other than putting a road through this location. It was truly obvious. The trees when they died or were blown over, fell in straight rows. The trunks of the trees were so straight that when Chad and I went exploring, we walked on top of them as if they were highways or sidewalks in the forest. But to get on top of one of the fallen trees was another issue.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_114710.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_114710\" width=\"423\" height=\"753\"><figcaption>The base of the tree is not even close to being in the picture</figcaption></figure>\n\nStanding next to the fallen trunk, Chad (6 ft) couldn\u2019t even reach his hand out to touch the top of it. We had to find other rocks or fallen trees that had decayed enough in order to climb up onto the dead tree. It was sprinking rain and if you looked up, you could slowly see individual rain drops falling from the branches above. I made a game out of catching the drops in my mouth like you would with snow flakes.\n\nHaving been seeing the majestic trees all day, we cut the tour of the Avenue of the Giants short to hop onto the highway. It was late afternoon and we still had to go through mountainous terrain at the tip of California to get to Oregon. The weather seemed to be getting worse and decided to rush through areas to get as far as we could before freezing weather struck.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_120427.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_120427\" width=\"582\" height=\"327\"><figcaption>Can you spot Chad?</figcaption></figure>\n\n<img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_121249.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_121249\" width=\"484\" height=\"863\">\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_1217311.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_121731\" width=\"675\" height=\"380\"><figcaption>I'm inside the half hollowed-out log</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_132632.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_132632\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>Itty bitty ant cars compared to these trees</figcaption></figure>\n<h3><img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_133015.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_133015\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"></h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Georgia', serif;color:#3d596d;\">Royal's Model Shots for a Volkswagen Advertisement</span></h3>\n\n<h3>Yellow Eyes</h3>\n<img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_141812.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_141812\" width=\"218\" height=\"291\">The sun light was blocked from the large pines as we climbed in and out of mountain hills. Finally, we were spit out onto flat land and were greeted by the sight of a town, Crescent City, in the distance. I really needed to use the bathroom and none of the gas stations were open. We finally pulling into a Denny\u2019s and I stepped out hurriedly.\n\nFrom listening to the audio book, there was a scene describing the main character fighting bare handed with wolves, the look of hunger in the wolves\u2019 eyes and details describing how she escaped alive. As I stepped out of the car, door still swinging shut, I found myself not more than 5 feet away from a wolf-like animal staring at me with gold eyes.\n\nIt happened so fast, but time stood still for me. While stepping out of the car, the noise had woken a sleeping dog that was resting under the bushes surrounding the Denny\u2019s building. The large dog casually jumped down off the ledge retaining wall that housed the bushes and stood to stare at me from the sidewalk.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_160037.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_160037\" width=\"534\" height=\"300\"><figcaption>A herd of elk resting in the afternoon sun</figcaption></figure>\n\nMaintaining eye contact, I reached back to grab the still moving door and thrusted myself into the passenger seat panting as if I had just sprinted a 400-meter dash. \u201cThere -there\u2019s \u2013 THERE\u2019S A WOLF RIGHT THERE!\u201d I screamed as Chad looked up from Google Maps. I calmed down and leaned forward to watch my foe. It was a very large, wolf-like dog with matted brown and grey hair. It didn\u2019t seem to have a collar on as it lurked away through the parking lot. I sure did not want to go back outside but my bladder was going to burst any minute. Needless to say, I was very alert for a long time after this encounter.<img src=\"/images/a-drive-through-a-giants-land/20170102_1154131.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_115413\" width=\"2984\" height=\"5312\">",

    "content": "<h2>Day 17 Continued: Crescent City, California and Grants Pass, Oregon</h2>\n*Images are from during the day because this entire post is about the evening events*\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_1326401.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_132640\" width=\"2976\" height=\"5312\" /><figcaption>Catching rain drops</figcaption></figure>\n\nBefore climbing into the nearby mountains, we grabbed some Hawaiian BBQ for dinner.\u00a0 I would like to point out that this restaurant was of my choosing and it was a success.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to credit Chad for all of the awesome places we eat, even though his track record is pretty good.\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_1804451.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_180445\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" />\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_1044251.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_104425\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\" />Hitting the road after dinner, it had started to pour sheets of rain as we drove towards the only road that will get us into Oregon as safely as possible.\u00a0 Cranking up the audio book, Chad concentrated on the curves, inclines and sudden declines on our path as the rain kept coming down.\u00a0 As we worked our way into the mountains, I recalled that it would take us around 2 hours to get from Crescent City, California to Grants Pass, Oregon.\u00a0 Boy, was I wrong.\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_104459.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_104459\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\" />\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_132704.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_132704\" width=\"2976\" height=\"5312\" />\n\nThe rain began to freeze and the snow plummeted down, decking the pine trees around us in a pretty white glaze.\u00a0 The road brought us in and out of the forest to overlook large drop-offs to a creek below.\u00a0 The snow began to thicken and Chad charged on knowing that we could not stop in this mountain range until we made it to our destination.\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_160514.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_160514\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" />\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_1044131.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_104413\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\" />\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_1556361.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_155636\" width=\"657\" height=\"369\" />\n\nThe audio book distracted us both and we sat in comfort listening to the story.\u00a0 We saw a few cars here and there passing us, but hardly any behind or in front of us.\u00a0 We were solo travelers until we came across one of the largest pine trees I have ever seen resting across the entire road.\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_221000.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_221000\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" />The car came to a halt in front of the tree and outside of a Wild Cat\u2019s building; it must have been a tourist trap that was closed for the winter season.\u00a0 I immediately thought the parking lot to this place could wrap around to the other side and bypass the tree.\u00a0 But, a Subaru Outback hosting 3 mountain teenagers, rolled up and tried to go around, just as I had imagined.\u00a0 They only made it about 20 feet before immediately reversing back onto the road.\u00a0 There was no way our small cars were going to get through the thick snow.\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_210234.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_210234\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" />\n\nOk, so that back up plan was out.\u00a0 Looking forward to stare at the tree in our high beams, I noticed the pine had fallen from the left onto the road, but by doing so, had fallen onto a power line.\u00a0 Not only is there a tree in the road but there is also the reality that someone could be electrocuted if the line was still active.\n\nChad and I racked our brains for any information we knew about electric emergencies or how to deal with them.\u00a0 All we could come up with is the rubber of our tires are the only thing resistant to the electrical current.\u00a0 But that wouldn\u2019t help much because if Chad decided to drive over the tip of the pine tree, the branches would totally touch the side of metal car and could potentially electrocute us. We were stuck on a mountain.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_210230.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_210230\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" /><figcaption>Chad is wearing the green jacket</figcaption></figure>\n\nCars were starting to accumulate on both sides of the fallen tree and there now was plenty of light to see how massive this obstacle was.\u00a0 One of the three local mountain boys pulled out a chain saw from the back of the Subaru and was heading over to start hacking away the top of the tree.\u00a0 Chad got out and went to warn him about getting anywhere near the tree with the potential live current.\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_210758.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_210758\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" />Drivers from the cars behind us started to come investigate the tree, walked right up to it and were touching the branches.\u00a0 Chad deemed this action as \u2018safe enough\u2019 and went to go look with the other guys standing around.\u00a0 The mountain teenager reared his chainsaw and marched over to the rescue.\u00a0 All of the guys that were standing around started to help clear the branches away as the kid cut.\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_163821.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_163821\" width=\"383\" height=\"683\" />\n\nI watched in amazement as the tip of the tree was slowly cleared away, and with every branch removed, there was more hope that we wouldn\u2019t be stuck on this mountain.\n\nI glanced over to see what Chad was up to, and right as I looked over, a branch Chad was tossing into the ditch came back to aggressively smack him on the left side of his face.\u00a0 I flinched for him and saw the culprits on the other side of him.\u00a0 A few other guys were throwing branches into the ditch when Chad was throwing his.\n\nWhen I asked Chad hours later, he said that their branch had fallen onto his branch which caused it to immediately kick back, hitting him in the face.\u00a0 The only damage suffered was a few small cuts around the eye, the side of the left temple and small bruising that became prominent the next day.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_170119.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_170119\" width=\"307\" height=\"547\" /><figcaption>Hail!</figcaption></figure>\n\nThe right side of the lane was almost clear when someone had grabbed a hold of the branch the chainsaw was cutting.\u00a0 The pulling motion derailed the chain on the saw and the process immediately stopped.\u00a0 Everyone started to go back to their cars and Chad bolted for our car.\n\nHe wanted to be the first one through to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be stuck behind people he couldn\u2019t trust driving through the mountain.\n\nPassing through the tight space on the road, we were immediately stopped by a mountain police officer that was waiting on the other side.\u00a0 This was one of the worst mistakes this officer could have made.\n\nThe snow had been falling heavily this entire time and when we came to a stop next to his vehicle, it was likely we wouldn\u2019t be able to pull forward without sliding into his car.\n\nHe apologized for making us stop (for literally nothing other than to look at us through our window) and we attempted to drive forward.\u00a0 We slid towards the cop car, stopped and retried until we scooted by without a scratch.\u00a0 Phew.\n\nDriving away was easy and we flew down the road with adrenaline pumping through our veins.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t think we were going to get out of that one!\n\nWhile driving on this road trip, we ask people on the side of the road it they need help and most of the time they say they have it covered.\u00a0 There was a car with hazards flashing and a guy looking under the hood of his car.\u00a0 The snow was still coming down relentlessly and it wouldn\u2019t be stopping anytime soon.\u00a0 To think the tree was bad enough, what happened next topped anything we have encountered on this trip.\n<h3>Winter storm weed</h3>\nThe car in distress had apparently run out of gas.\u00a0 The nearest gas station was 20 miles away, and with road conditions the way they are, it would take over an hour to get there and maybe not even make it back.\u00a0 The man was maybe in his late 40s, dressed in dark winter clothing, his face well-worn and was missing teeth.\u00a0 Looking inside the car, the passenger seat held a woman who I thought was his mother and instantly began to worry about their safety on a night like this.\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_1047532.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_104753\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\" /><figcaption>Me caught popping a squat because there were not bathrooms in sight</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_1658031.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_165803\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\" /><figcaption>Chad gallantly wrote his name in the sand and took a picture to share his art with me. \u00a0Guess how he made it?</figcaption></figure>\n\nChad offered to give them a ride to their house, which was only 3-ish miles up the road.\u00a0 I looked at him with horror.\u00a0 You can\u2019t trust anyone anymore and you are not supposed to pick up people on the side of the road if you value your safety/life.\u00a0 This was happening and they were getting in our car.\n\nChad and I cleared our sleeping gear and bags out the back seat and packed the trunk completely full.\u00a0 The two people piled into our car and the air instantly filled with the skunky smell of weed.\u00a0 Getting a closer look at the woman, she was almost the same age as the guy she was with and I assumed she was the girl friend.\u00a0 She also was missing teeth (I could only see 1 or 2), wasn\u2019t dressed for the weather and had a voice like a practiced chain smoker.\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_1656501.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_165650\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\" />All of the alarm bells were going off in my head.\u00a0 What did we just do?\u00a0 Chad continued to drive steadily for the longest 3 miles of my life.\u00a0 The people in the back seat wouldn\u2019t shut up and the girl was talking 80 miles an hour.\n\nWe openly discovered, without having to hardly ask any questions, that they both were weed dealers and they thought we looked like Trimmers.\u00a0 Apparently, Trimmers are traveling people who come to cut the leaves off of the weed plants.\u00a0 The informed us that we were in Oregon and were laughing about how we didn\u2019t know weed was legal in this state.\u00a0 This was, in their opinion, the best place in the whole country to grow weed because of the climate.\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_1656191.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_165619\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\" />They went on and on and on about their varieties, selling patterns, growing seasons and asked multiple times if we would like to purchase their products.\u00a0 They weren\u2019t paying any attention to the road and I had to keep reminding them to tell us where to go.\u00a0 We dipped off the road onto an unplowed dirt road that had only been driven on by the big super duty trucks.\n\nThe momentum from the small hill was the only thing keeping are car going forward and Chad hammered on the gas to propel us through the deep snow.\u00a0 Thank goodness for these freaking amazing Canadian snow tires.\u00a0 If a tree didn\u2019t stop us, this deep snow would and it almost did.\u00a0 The girl apologized for making us take this way because, \u201cI always take this road and didn\u2019t think about the snow.\u201d\u00a0 Well no duh lady.\n\nWe dropped them off outside a shack and they rolled out of the car. \u00a0Chad got out to check the back seat with his flash light and found the guy\u2019s wallet sitting on the seat.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 They thanked us, told us how to get out and we were on our way as fast as possible.\u00a0 We almost got stuck trying to get up a hill that lead to the main road and had to accelerate rapidly to barely make it onto the road.\n\n<img src=\"/images/trapped-on-a-mountain/20170102_1654491.jpg\" alt=\"20170102_165449\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\" />If I was driving this entire time, we would have been toast.\u00a0 Now extremely exhausted from the drive all day and the few hours\u2019 events, we trucked out of the mountains as safely as we could.\u00a0 It took us 4 hours to get out of the mountain when it was supposed to take only around 2, but I can\u2019t complain because we never slid down the mountain, crashed into a tree, froze to death or had to spend the night with the weed dealers to wait out the storm.\u00a0 Completely shot, we fell instantly asleep at a truck stop not caring too much if people saw us sleeping or not.",

    "content": "<h3>Day 18 Location: Oregon, Washington</h3>\n<h3>Day 19 Location: Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota</h3>\n<h3>Day 20 Location: Woodbury, Minnesota</h3>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Endless Day</h2>\n<p>Congratulations team Katie and Chad, you have not died on a mountain or have been killed by strangers in your car! Exhaustion was setting in and we both did not want to get up in the morning. We have never set alarms on this trip, letting our bodies wake up naturally, but this time I would have appreciated physically swiping the snooze button on my phone.</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_132113.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_132113\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>Portland, Oregon</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>School would start in a few days for me and Chad would have to go back to work, but we were still on the opposite side of the country. We decided that we weren\u2019t going to camp again (physically parking the car to sleep) and our plan was to rally drive all the way home. Oh boy.</p>\n\n<h3>Oregon</h3>\n<p>Oregon was nothing I ever expected it to be. There were large and small hills following the highway with shacks/houses decorating the ledges. Every town we drove through was very small and we kept driving without batting an eye. Our audio book at the time was getting really good, so good in fact, I can only remember the story line and not the scenery of what we were passing through.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">The Progression of Chad's beard growth over the course of the trip</h3>\n\n<p>Chad was still driving and would drive the rest of the day because he liked to. His appearance has changed drastically since we left Minnesota because of his beard. From time to time I would catch him stroking his beard as if he was thinking about a serious topic and the motion helped him to think clearly. Since we haven\u2019t been showering regularly and boycotting all shampoos/conditioners, his hair surprisingly still looked good.</p>\n<p>Slicked into the man bun, which is finally long enough for a pony tail since his last haircut, Chad fit well into the mountain surroundings. The lifestyle he is portraying with the long beard, long hair, athletic Patagonia clothing and diesel Jetta is strikingly similar to a wanderer or hippie. Maybe a classy, technical hippie. Not to mention he loves, absolutely loves, sleeping in the car. This trip has created a monster that will not enjoy coming back to reality.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">The Progression of Katie's hair curls over the course of the trip</h3>\n<p>The entire trip has been without shampoo or conditioner. The only treatment was intense scrubbing and rinsing of the scalp/hair. It would then be brushed when wet and left to air dry. You can see the difference in texture from the first picture to the last picture.</p>\n\n<p>Taking a look at myself, I was still wearing the same clothing from 2 or 3 days prior. It\u2019s hard to remember when the days all blend into one. Having kept up with our hygiene practices, we didn\u2019t stink and we still felt comfortable. I have also not been using shampoo or conditioner on the trip but instead have been intensely scrubbing then rinsing my hair. The natural oils have been able to build up for the first time ever and my curls are astounding. There\u2019s a catch: I have to rinse my hair out and let it air dry for the best results. If this doesn\u2019t happen, I will of course look like someone who hasn\u2019t take a shower for a long time. It\u2019s a fine line between beauty and homeless haha.</p>\n<p>By the end of the day, we had passed through Oregon entranced with our audio book and had set the course to Seattle for dinner. Chad, having an obsession with Starbuck\u2019s coffee shops, knew the original location was in Pike\u2019s Place Market. Not knowing what we would find, we made our way across Washington. By this time, we had eaten almost every horded piece of food in the car and we were looking forward to the delicacies the city would offer.</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_162045.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_162045\" width=\"582\" height=\"327\"><figcaption>Driving into Seattle during rush hour</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>I have been meaning to travel to Washington to visit my other family, the Hickmans, in Walla Walla. Unfortunately, we were unable to stop due to tight driving deadlines. During all four years of high school, I had spent my afternoons working in the Hickman\u2019s sheep barns helping with chores, lambing and moving sheep. I absolutely loved every minute of it, even when the sheep were being stupid. The Hickmans have recently up-rooted their farm, trekked across the country to Washington and have started a new life in the rolling hills of Walla Walla with their sheep. Visiting them should be my next vacation and I will totally be bringing my work boots to help out with the sheep. Having been away from manual labor or farm work for a few years, I can\u2019t believe I miss it.</p>\n<h3>Pike\u2019s Place</h3>\n\n<p>Rush hour in Seattle heading out of the city was horrendous. The line of cars were backed up for at least 20 miles out of the city. Yuck. Chad and I arrived in Seattle around 4:30 p.m. and headed straight for the market. We were starving and getting very crabby. The city had a different feel than San Francisco, but it was still refreshing to see compared to the little towns we had been passing all day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_162429.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_162429\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\">The curse of staying hydrated in the car is not having an immediate bathroom to use. I had tried to stay hydrated all day but I was paying for it. We found a parking stop on the cobble stone in the heart of the market and I immediately was bathroom hunting. There were people everywhere, smells of foods I couldn\u2019t distinguish and colors galore. There was an actual market with fresh fruits and veggies, fish, sea food and roots. Everything looked so appetizing. But first, I needed a bathroom.</p>\n<p>We wandered inside the strip behind the stores to find an Asian family frantically running by me and Chad. The woman in the group looked like she also had to use the bathroom and I was thrilled. We followed them until they came to a bathroom but they didn\u2019t stop. I wanted to stop, over joyed that I can finally go, but Chad was persistent that we follow them. He claimed that they had a look on their faces like they were going to go find something amazing, but they had to hurry to get there. Chad thought that this group of people would lead us to the Holy Grail but my Holy Grail was through the woman\u2019s restroom door.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_162651.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_162651\" width=\"493\" height=\"277\"></p>\n<p>Not wanting to be left alone in a large city, I hurriedly followed after Chad as we trailed the Asian family. They scooted around corridors inside the building and we found ourselves standing outside a clam chowder restaurant. The Asian family looked absolutely thrilled that they had made it to this place on time before they closed and Chad was practically crawling out of his skin with this amazing discovery. Apparently, this place has won contests for the best clam chowder in the States multiple years in a row and we were about to try some. Chad could have been happier than a clam. See what I did there?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_164646.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_164646\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\">It was the best damn chowder I have ever had. We saddled up to the bar and tried our different chowders. We got there just in time because they were closing at 5 p.m. and it was 4:50 p.m. The line out of the shop was at least 10-15 people deep; all waiting to buy chowder before closing time. Wow.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_164033.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_164033\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_164057.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_164057\" width=\"168\" height=\"300\">I had forgotten that I was going to burst from not using the bathroom. Oops. I rushed out of the chowder place and hunted for another bathroom. We both were hopelessly still hungry and were easily sucked into any appetizing food that was on display in the street. We settled for gyros sold to us from a Russian woman who complained of the cold (we could see our breath and a jacket was required). She told us about the use of legal marijuana in Washington and how she would rather stick to a good scotch for entertainment.</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_172634.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_172634\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>The first Starbucks ever</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_162841.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_162841\" width=\"546\" height=\"973\"></p>\n<p>The street air was littered with the aroma of weed and people were bumbling about obviously having a \u2018good time\u2019. Taking the suggestions of people who worked in the shops, we sought after homemade mac and cheese. At this time it was a food frenzy because all of the shops, except for a few, would be closing. If we were to get any of the suggested items, we had to hustle. Running from shop to shop, Chad and I loaded up on varieties of food.</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_163620.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_163620\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>The view from our car</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_170831.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_170831\" width=\"248\" height=\"444\">Gyros and mac in hand, we went back to the car to eat. I may or may not have walked through a group of guys that were standing by the car that seemed \u2018questionable\u2019 because they were so baked. I didn\u2019t think anything of it and when I got in the car I was sternly reminded that I should be more aware of my surroundings (aka sketchy people). Yes, good point. I was just so consumed with the thoughts of eating my gyro!</p>\n<p>Scarfing down everything, it was time for dessert. We high tailed it back to a German dessert shop and got our hands on some pretty bomb pastries. Mine had rhubarb in it; ugh, it was heavenly. The sun had set, we were full and the traffic was still terrible.</p>\n\n<p><figure><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_165801.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_165801\" width=\"211\" height=\"376\"><figcaption>Mac and cheese - They really love cheese here</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>As of now at 7 p.m., this would be the last stop on our trip and we would now be rally driving all the way back to Minnesota. If you travel to Seattle, visit this market place. I would have loved to spend hours looking through everything and wasting my money on food.</p>\n\n<h3><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_174134.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_174134\" width=\"445\" height=\"250\"></h3>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h2>Not Stopping for Anything</h2>\n<h3>Day 19 Location: Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota</h3>\n<p>Chad took the first driving shift and I passed out in the reclined passenger seat around 9 p.m. All I remember leaving the city and seeing the lights as we passed by. Traffic was still bad but I remember beginning the climb into the mountains. I fell asleep to the audio book and occasionally came to and would look outside to see snow, mountain rocks and high beam lights. Deeming this unimportant, I would fall back asleep.</p>\n<p>Waking up as Chad pulled into a gas station, I thought I had only passed out for about an hour. He showed me the time on his phone and I didn\u2019t understand it. The time was 3:30 but I didn\u2019t know if it was a.m. or p.m.. A groggy mind really confused me and I realized it was 3 in the morning! Chad had been driving my unconscious self across Washington for 6 hours. He looked absolutely awful. This hair was a mess, his eyes blood shot and there were huge dark rings under his eyes. It was totally my turn to drive.</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_162837.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_162837\" width=\"608\" height=\"341\"><figcaption>Heading to the Market</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Chad was passed out even before I was able to get back onto the highway. My suggestion to night drivers or people who aren\u2019t used to long driving times at night: get an audio book or podcast. The book literally saved me from falling asleep because I had to pay attention to the storyline. It was peaceful traveling through the remainder of the mountains (I had forced Chad to drive them if he wanted to live) and watching the landscape change from hilly to flat.</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170103_173814.jpg\" alt=\"20170103_173814\" width=\"596\" height=\"335\"><figcaption>Watching the backed-up traffic from the Market overlook</figcaption></figure></p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\">Obstacles Katie Avoided in the Road</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A large tumble weed the size of a Christmas tree</li>\n<li>An 8\u2019 ladder in the left lane</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170104_074954.jpg\" alt=\"20170104_074954\" width=\"584\" height=\"438\"></p>\n<p>Having avoided obstacles in the road, I caught up to the part in the book where Chad ended when I had woken. Woot Woot, 6 hours! We rallied like this all the way across Washington, Idaho, Montana and North Dakota. It was so discouraging to be driving through Fargo around dinner time because I couldn\u2019t stay and go back to my apartment. All of my things and my car were back in Minnesota waiting patiently for me to return. Chad and I could have spent the night at my place, said hi to my lonely roommate and stretched but it was easier to complete the remaining 4-hour drive. If we stop now, there is no way we are getting back in the car to keep driving.</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170104_074944.jpg\" alt=\"20170104_074944\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>My first real view of Montana - Chad is fast asleep</figcaption></figure><br>\n<figure><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170104_075345.jpg\" alt=\"20170104_075345\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\"><figcaption>Feeling sad knowing the trip is almost over</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>We had dinner at Johnny Carino\u2019s in Fargo, an Italian restaurant, to stock up on comfort food. This was our last meal while on vacation and reality was literally starring me in the face (NDSU campus is not that far away and my apartment just up the road). I drove the rest of the way back to Woodbury, MN. We arrived at a decent hour around 11 p.m. and the trip was over. But the audio book wasn\u2019t! We had only 40 minutes to go! Dragging our car-worn bodies into the house, it was a relief to be home in Minnesota.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170104_180728.jpg\" alt=\"20170104_180728\" width=\"573\" height=\"322\"></p>\n<h2>Day 20 Location: Woodbury, Minnesota</h2>\n<p>In the morning, Chad caught up on emails while I emptied the car. Having pulled everything out, I found items that I didn\u2019t know we brought. More than half of the things I hauled out weren\u2019t even used. This proves that we can bring a small amount of items next time and still be fine. Later, Chad vacuumed Royal and we got rid of the nasty smell of \u2018humans living in a car for weeks at a time\u2019 odor.</p>\n<p><figure><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170105_113855.jpg\" alt=\"20170105_113855\" width=\"424\" height=\"755\"><figcaption>Everything that was in the car placed on the floor, table and counters</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The car had been cleaned, my items packed for my trip back to Fargo and the monster road trip was officially completed. The audio book was also shortly finished when I made my way back to Fargo, which I think, officially officially ended the trip.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/1997-miles-to-go/20170105_215943.jpg\" alt=\"20170105_215943\" width=\"2592\" height=\"1944\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>We are sure glad to be home and not in a moving vehicle. </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>We love Minnesota, you betcha!</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"has-2-columns\">\n\n</div>",

    "content": "<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">#EastCoastJetta</p>\n\n<p>It's been a little while since Chad and I have hit the road on an extended vacation, so we may be a little rusty. But, I would say that we are much more prepared since the <a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/category/2016-west-coast-road-trip/\">2016 West Cost Road Trip</a> as we have continued to research ideas to make our traveling lives more efficient while living in a car for extended periods of time.</p>\n\n<p>The latest road trip starting April 1 will take us to the East Coast of the United States (a Canada east and west coming along in the future). Chad and I plan to duck down to Texas to visit a friend in Dallas and then make our way to the coast. From there, we will follow the water to Florida and ride all the way up to Maine. There is no end date in sight.</p>\n\n<p>This trip we have a new family member, Jetta Hall (pronounced H-\u0101-ll), as Chad turned in Jetta Royal with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal\">Volkswagen emissions scandal</a>. With the new car, we are excited to put on plenty of miles and see where we go.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"> Improve the Travel Methods</p>\n\n<p> Below are a few examples of ways to improve an extended stay in a vehicle.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div class=\"alignwide\"><figure><img src=\"/images/where-to-begin-a-trip/20170623_122524.jpg\" /></figure><p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Pack Less<br>Clean More<br>Stretch Often</p></div>\n\n<ul><li>Learning from previous trips, a majority of the items brought with were just shuffled around the car the entire time and never used. Only bring items that are extremely necessary and you can imagine using on a daily bases.</li><li>Keeping yourself and the space you live clean in is absolutely mandatory. Keep and improve upon personal hygiene methods/routines to keep you and your travel partners happy. No one likes sitting next to a sack of ripe onions. Wet wipes are a must for spills and a hippie car shower. Make sure to unclutter your environment and only have out items that you need. It's easier to locate items and makes you feel better when your environment isn't encroaching on you.</li><li>Make time to get out of the vehicle and stretch. Take a hike, go for a walk around your destination or even consider running laps around the local truck stop. Do something to extend your muscles to help reduce stiff joints. It seems like a no-brainer, but once on the road it is actually really easy to forget about moving around when constantly cruising on the highways.</li></ul>\n\n<div class=\"alignwide\"><figure><img src=\"/images/where-to-begin-a-trip/20170623_101529.jpg\" /></figure><p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Mood Check<br>Vehicle Check<br>Supply Check</p></div>\n\n<ul><li>The key to an enjoyable vacation is people's moods. If your travel buddy is a little sour or down in the dumps, it could impact your day. If moods are a little all over the place, Chad and I have come to the conclusion that one of us is either hungry, needs to do some sort of physical exercise (Chad prefers going for a run; Katie likes to do yoga or hike), or there needs to be an open conversation about how the other is feeling. Seriously, it's that easy to keep us happy. Figure out what works for you and stick to it.</li><li>Prep the vehicle with supplies for regular maintenance. Now, don't bring the whole garage with you. We usually pack a jump start kit, a funnel, window washer fluid, microfiber cloths, window and interior car cleaner, paper towels, tire pressure gauge, cigarette lighter phone chargers and power converters. </li><li>Bring items that will help with your activities that you plan on doing. This could include yoga mats, roller blades, tennis rackets, hiking and camping equipment, 5+ gallons of water, a little bit of extra food and the minimal amount of clothing/footwear needed to complete your trip. </li></ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Each trip will test your prepping skills and there will be cases where you aren't as prepared as you would like to be. It happens, it's part of the journey. I would rather under-pack than over-pack because I can always go purchase the item needed or make do without it. If it's the reverse, there is way too much stuff and not enough space for souvenirs. Wish us luck!</p>",

      "2019 East Coast Road Trip"
    ],

    "content": "<p>Day 1 - Well, the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.\u00a0 When we first went on our West Coast road trip in 2016, <a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/2016/12/15/chad-is-stubborn/\">Chad wouldn\u2019t get in the car</a> because he had to clean the entire house and car, review the supplies a million times before we started, research this and update that and we didn\u2019t get on the road until later in the afternoon. </p>\n\n<p> We have repeated history and worked to get ourselves settled starting at 5:30 a.m. and finally pulled out of the driveway around 12:30 p.m. Only for me to forget my passport. Oops. First U-turn of the trip.</p>\n\n<p>So, where to? The\ngeneral plan is to take I-35 south through Iowa, Missouri and head to Kansas\nCity. From there, we have a choice of\nsneaking over to Saint Louis, MO or down to Dallas, TX to see a friend.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>\"The Name's Chad, Clean-Shaven Chad\"</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Since I have known Chad, he has always had some sort of facial hair and I have never seen what his actual face looks like.\u00a0 We have been joking for a while that when the next road trip comes along, he should shave his beard off and see how long it takes to grow back. </p>\n\n<p>(Cheesy James Bond reference since we just completed a 5 month journey to watch the James Bond movies in the order they were produced.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\u00a0\u00a0 Today\u2019s the day!</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"beard-progression\" style=\"display:flex;gap:8px;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;margin:1.5em 0\">\n<img alt=\"Full beard\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190401_054456-copy-1.jpg\" style=\"width:18%;border-radius:8px\" />\n<img alt=\"Trimmed cheeks\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190401_055357-copy.jpg\" style=\"width:18%;border-radius:8px\" />\n<img alt=\"Goatee only\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190401_060126-copy.jpg\" style=\"width:18%;border-radius:8px\" />\n<img alt=\"Mustache only\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190401_060551-copy.jpg\" style=\"width:18%;border-radius:8px\" />\n<img alt=\"Clean-shaven\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190401_061807-copy.jpg\" style=\"width:18%;border-radius:8px\" />\n</div>\n\n<p>He is so not the same person! He sounds the same, but whenever I look at\nhim I do a double-take because he is not the Chad I know. What a transformation; he totally cut off\nyears from his face. He said he looks\nlike he could be casted as a high school kid for the Disney channel. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Blog & Freelance\nfrom Anywhere</strong></h2>\n\n<p>With the need to use a laptop for blogging and working while on the road, Chad has engineered a work space for me.\u00a0 There are three pieces that come a part for easy storage and can be quickly assembled (after practice).\u00a0 All he needed was plywood, 1x1s, screws and 10mm bullet casings.\u00a0 To make the pieces assemble quickly, he used the bullet casings as dowels so they pop into pre-drilled holes in the two supporting sides.\u00a0 It is absolutely wonderful. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190328_094812.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190328_145313.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190328_094834.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190328_094320.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190329_131232.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad even sanded the entire top surface to prevent slivers, rounded the corners, cut out a curve for the torso and designed the desk to allow the car\u2019s middle console to still open.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry, the two cup holders are also still accessible.\u00a0 You can\u2019t have enough cup holders on a road trip.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>First Stop, Grandma\u2019s\nHouse</strong></h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190401_141236-copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Nothing better than stopping off for a pancake brunch at Chad\u2019s grandparent\u2019s house to start the trip.\u00a0 Thank you!\u00a0 These lovely humans shared with us their experiences of when they took road trips in their 60+ years of marriage.\u00a0 One story we thought was hilarious was when they were traveling in areas that had very few gas stations.\u00a0 They actually had to push the car into the station because they completely ran out of gas and only had fumes to spare. </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>With fully tummies, a packed car, and some sense of direction, we said good-bye and headed off towards Iowa.</p></blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"alignwide\"><figure><img src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190401_181527.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure><h2><strong>Who Need\u2019s Gas? </strong></h2></div>\n\n<p>We finished off the rest of the daylight without even having to turn on the radio or listen to a podcast/book.\u00a0 This is because Chad and Katie were lit off coffee and tea from brunch. We constantly were bouncing ideas everywhere while I researched and read articles pertaining to those ideas.\u00a0 Imagine two squirrels sitting in a car, trying to communicate about everything all at once.</p>\n\n<p>Des Moines finally popped up in our view and we made our way\nto Costco to fuel up. But, when mapped\nout, the destination was about 30 miles a way and Chad said we only had about\n40 miles left before completely empty. Confidently, we continued our way\nthinking we would be able to make it. \nYikes. The gauge kept dropping miles like dead flies \u2013 ticking away in 5-mile\nincrements. </p>\n\n<p>Sweating heavily, we were about 5 miles from our destination when the digital gas gauge said we only had 5 miles of gas left in the tank.\u00a0 Now the car is extremely hot, we are leaned forward in our seats, barely accelerating and openly commanding the stop lights to stay green so we could coast on through.\u00a0 Funny sense of humor they had \u2013 all red lights. </p>\n\n<p>Limping along into the Costco parking lot, we prayed there was a gas station at this location (on the GPS it looked like there was) and we slowly went around the perimeter looking for it.\u00a0 When we finally pulled up to the pump, the gauge said 0 miles left and we let out a huge sigh. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190401_181620.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Funny how earlier that day, Chad\u2019s grandparents told us their\nstory about running out of gas and we just HAD to replicate the situation. What a rush!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Sashimi Please</strong></h2>\n\n<p>With Costco (wet wipes!!!) and Scheel\u2019s Sporting Goods (MSR\ncamp towel for Katie and propane for the grill) shopping trips out of the way,\nit\u2019s time for dinner. Chad rearranged\nthe car to make more space while I prepped a sashimi yellow tail dinner on the\nnew desk.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190401_192827.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190401_192813.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We had purchased a sushi-grade yellow tail piece of fish and had it thawing in a cooler during the day.\u00a0 So, it was perfectly ready to eat by the time we stopped.\u00a0 Dinner consisted of an entire chunk of yellow tail, fried bean curd, bamboo shoots and three different types of sauces to dip the fish in.\u00a0 There was not enough room for the tomatoes.\u00a0 The fish was super filling and refreshing.\u00a0 We are not too sure about the bean curd and the bamboo shoots would probably be better in a stir fry.\u00a0 Either way, super bizarre and crazy first car camping meal.</p>\n\n<div class=\"alignwide\"><figure><img src=\"/images/grandmas-house/20190401_222813.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure><h2>First Camp</h2></div>\n\n<p>Chad continued to drive into Missouri and we broke camp at a Love\u2019s Travel Station.\u00a0 All cleaned up from dinner, we prepped the car for sleeping.\u00a0 Of course, Chad manages to get his space all ready to go in no time and I am fidgeting everything around for the next 20 minutes.\u00a0 We brought at least 8+ pillows which we packed under our feet, lower back, head and next to the doors to lay our heads against.\u00a0 Once settled, it\u2019s really comfy.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Check: </strong>Teeth flossed and brushed, sleeping masks adorned, blankets arranged, windows cracked for air, and we are good to go for the night.</p>",

    "content": "<h2><strong>First Sleeping\nSession</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Day 2: We are a little rusty when it comes to prepping the car for sleeping. Over the course of the trip, we will figure out a routine so that all of the pillows, blankets, sleeping bag (for me because I am colder at night than Chad) and gear is ready to go within 10 minutes. This night it took at least an hour to get settled and Chad was out like a light. </p>\n\n<p>The first night sleeping in the car went great for Chad and\nsemi-ok for me. I defiantly did not have\nthe pillows under my legs situated right and half the time my arms had fallen\nasleep. Better luck next time, huh? While Chad has literally not moved since he fell\nasleep, I have witnessed in the wee hours of the morning a white Ford pickup truck\nsquealing tires through the Love\u2019s Truck Stop parking lot, wiz by the gas pumps,\nburning rubber in a large circle all while the occupant males are hootin\u2019 and\nholleran\u2019 at the top of their lungs profanity statements. Maybe a car chase? Who knows, but it was loud!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Creating the Right\nWork Environment</strong></h2>\n\n<p>A billboard we passed on the highway read, \u201care you harassed\nat work? I blurted out, \u201cYes, yes I am!\u201d\nfor chad has been harassing me all morning, pelting me with ideas he would like\nme to research while I am using my desk (one example is learning about how much\npower I have in my laptop USB drivers to then potentially add an additional\nmonitor later). </p>\n\n<p>He also has thought about what needs to be put into the blog\nand has already laid out a format for me to use. There is nothing wrong with suggestions, but he\nonly has one job right now and that is to drive! The creative juices cannot flow when someone\nelse\u2019s thoughts are permeating your own.</p>\n\n<p>Chad did have a helpful suggestion for making the blogging\nprocess quicker by setting up folders for pictures to go into on the phone,\nwhich would make uploading and editing the blog a lot faster. Ok\u2026thank you, Chad, that was helpful.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Off to Kansas City\n(MO & KS)</strong></h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_133445-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Arriving mid-morning in Kansas City, we drove around and\naround. There are so many buildings and\nhomes with the oldest stones I have ever seen. \nThere are a ton of big buildings in the Light District, but also scattered\ninside the residential areas. The grass is actually green and spring has been\nhere for a while - road construction season!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_113642.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_113453.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>I was able to find a cool little coffee shop, Quay Coffee, in the River Market District where there used to be city trolley systems - the railways were still engraved in the pavement. After about an hour of working on writing while Chad caught up with friends, we were both so jazzed from the coffee that we were both talking ninety miles an hour. Having not had anything in our stomachs to soak it up, the coffee hit us like a train.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/img_20190402_170129_319.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/JT2foJsT\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2><strong>National WW1 Museum\n& Memorial </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Many of the local museums are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, but the WW1 Museum happened to be open. \u201cThe National WWI Museum and Memorial is America's museum dedicated to remembering, interpreting and understanding the Great War and its enduring impact on the global community.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theworldwar.org/\">Check out the National WW1 Museum</a> if you are ever in town. </p>\n\n<p>The tower had an elevator which we rode to the top and we\nwere able to gaze at the vast infrastructure laid far below. The city is endless concrete, high-rises,\ngreen spaces, large monuments and buildings completely made from old stone. Chad being Chad commented, \u201cthis would be an awkward\ntime for an earthquake\u2026\u201d as we are 217 odd feet above the ground.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_140044.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_140919.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_141041.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_141058.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_141122.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_141142.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_141535.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_141550.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We chatted with a volunteer about the painting '<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/pantheon-de-la-guerre-wwi-painting/index.html\">Panth\u00e9on de la Guerre</a>' , which used to be the World\u2019s Largest painting. \u201cIts creators wanted to honor the greatest war the world had ever seen with the greatest painting ever made, and they had spent the previous four years working on it with the help of 150 artists.\u201d It was so stunning and large that when Chad backed up to see it, he ran into a bench and plummeted onto it, absolutely stunned he is now sitting and at the size of the painting.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_144031-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_145224.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The remaining portion of the museum was found beneath the\nmonuments and detailed the history of the Great War. There\nwere a plethora of artifacts, videos, reenactments, cannons, guns, planes,\ncars, motorcycles, military gear of all fighting nations, war propaganda\nposters (hand drawn) and so much more. \nWhat a place. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_150803.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_145904.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_145418.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_144429.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_150825.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_153258.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_162035.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_144017-1.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_144058.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2><strong>BBQ , It\u2019s What\u2019s for\nDinner</strong></h2>\n\n<p>After asking for recommendations from friends and the locals,\nit was a hard choice to select a place to grab some BBQ. We settled on <em>Joe\u2019s Kansas City BBQ</em> and when we arrived at the location, we were\npretty sure GPS had missed their mark. \nThe restaurant was at a gas station?</p>\n\n<p>Wow, was this the coolest food experience so far. Inside the gas station, it immediately turned\ninto a order-at-the-counter restaurant and it had an entire section for people\nto sit down and eat. The gas station only\nhad a counter and maybe two rows of items for sale, which included BB sauces\nand rubs. The people working in the restaurant\nwere laughing, talking loudly and shouting out orders while the background noises\nwere food sizzling and pans banging.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_184316.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_184323.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_180020.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_180933.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We ended up with some blackened beef tips, ribs, a sandwich they are apparently known for, seasoned fries and a side of their homemade apple crisp. YUM.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_181113.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_181024.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_181021.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/wandering-kansas-city/20190402_181016.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>By the time we were done eating, it was around 7 p.m. and the line of people lwanting food was wrapped around the inside in a massive swirl to the point where the line was almost out the door. For sure almost 40 people waiting for food. We happened to get there when it was less busy, only 5th in line, around 5:30 p.m. Obviously, this is the place to be.</p>\n\n<p>Friends have been reaching out to see how the trip is going, specially when it comes to food. \"Dr Bublitz. Paging Dr Bublitz. BBQ report needed at the front office, stat!\" Chad is happy to report the BBQ beef tips were worth waiting in line for.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Sleep Time</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Settling on a local truck stop, Chad and I weaved our way\nthere through the city. Once at our\ndestination, we realized they were full-up with all of the trucks and trailers coming\nin for the night. There wasn\u2019t even a\nplace for our little car to fit (without getting towed). </p>\n\n<p>Improvising, we wandered the block and ended up parking in a rental truck service center not too far from the truck stop. Parking like one of their employees, we went unnoticed. Setting up for bed was a lot quicker and we were situated quickly. This time I adorned earplugs and was out like a light the entire night. Best nights sleep ever! Chad had no complaints and had a good night\u2019s rest as well.</p>",

    "content": "<h2><strong>The Employees are\nComing</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Day 3: \u201cChad, we have to get up! The employees are starting to park their cars around us.\u201d After spending the night all comfy-cozy-situated in the truck service center parking lot, it was time to get rolling as more cars started pulling in around 7 a.m. The quality of sleep was much improved as we are getting used to the recliner-like sleeping position in the front seats of the Jetta.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Viewing Homes & Sneaking\nWifi</strong></h2>\n\n<p>While Chad navigated to the art museum, I prepped my car\nwork station to work on a blog post. The\ndesk set up is super quick and it\u2019s been such a treat to be able to sit\ncomfortably while using the laptop. We wandered\nthe city checking out the infrastructure and homes, then found parking for\nvisiting the museum and waited until they opened at 10 a.m.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_080648-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_130455.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_081010.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Once parked, I snuck onto the museum\u2019s wifi and was able to\nwork on a blog post for the day before and that cleared up the rest of the\nmorning without having to drag the laptop supplies into a coffee shop. Good find Chad!</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_095219.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2><strong>Coffee with a Cop at\nthe Art Museum</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The grounds of the museum had trails to view art pieces and\nhad a large expanse of greenery in the back yard. This is where giant birdies were placed, like\nthe big spoon and cherry located in Minneapolis at the Walker Art Center.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_095334.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_095320.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_131046.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>I had read online about a coffee shop inside the museum, which\nwas known for their unique blends of coffee beans and had a view of large golden\ndoors on display. Might as well check it\nout before viewing the rest of the building. </p>\n\n<ul class=\"is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_102048.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure></li></ul>\n\n<p>When we approached the coffee shop, there was a Kansas City police man hanging out by the counter and we asked him what he would recommend for drinks to try.\u00a0 Super glad we did, because we then spent the next 45 minutes chatting.</p>\n\n<p>First, the coffee was amazing.\u00a0 Quay Coffee makes their own vanilla bean syrup and it had little tiny specs of vanilla floating around in our latte.\u00a0 We also had a cup of straight coffee that was very rich in flavor and was defiantly not Folgers. We ended up standing with the police officer, sipping away and learning about places to go see.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_102044.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>As the coffee set in, Chad and I lit up and loved chatting with this gentleman about how he would one day like to hike the Appalachian Trail, leave his gun behind and become vulnerable again as the hike would last over 5 months.\u00a0 Not vulnerable in the sense of being easily overcome by something, but the kind of vulnerable where you don\u2019t know everything.\u00a0 Where you are willing to learn and be humbled by your experiences, and to be able to see the good in people without instantly thinking they are planning to attack.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>He mentioned feeling tainted by the line of work he\u2019s in because he\u2019s always on guard, thinking tactically and always seeing the potential negative in anyone.\u00a0 He was inspired to go set the intention to travel and communicate with his wife to help bring the ideas to fruition.</p>\n\n<p>The policeman loved hearing about where we're road tripping to and then Chad (efficiently lit on caffeine by now and has traded cups with me so he wouldn\u2019t shake the cup/saucer duo in his hands to the regular coffee cup) proceeded to ask about his experiences with Airbnb, his opinion on truck stops for car camping and other locations where we should stop on the road.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>He loves using Airbnb for unique locations to get the experience of the town he\u2019s in, otherwise, him and his wife prefer to stay in bed and breakfasts.\u00a0 Truck stops would be his preferred location for car camping since there would be access to help, if needed, since it\u2019s a populated space.\u00a0 Granted, there are negatives to truck stops like potential drug deals, what he called \u201clot lizards\u201d (ladies offering their company) and other sketchy activities, but he said it\u2019s way better than being alone in a camp site where there is no one or without resources to help.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<ul class=\"is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_111124.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure></li></ul>\n\n<p>He was happy to hear we were wary of sleeping locations and are paying attention to our surroundings.\u00a0 He said we for sure needed to hit New Orleans for their chicory coffee at Cafe Du Monde and share a<a href=\"https://centralgrocery.com/\"> Muffuletta sandwich</a>.\u00a0 But, most of all, we have to hit Charleston, NC.\u00a0 Thanks for the tips and the chat!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Audio Book Voice Meets\nMinnesota Travelers</strong></h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_125324.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Now high on travel tips, great conversation and jittery from coffee, we finally made our way into the art museum. After looking around some of the rooms, we came across a museum volunteer who greeted us with the most amazing, deep and clear audio book/radio talent-like voice.\u00a0 Chad immediately started laughing and exclaimed, \u201cno way!\u201d and when we popped around the corner, there was a short, older gentleman dressed in a grey suit.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_111528.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_120205.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_123237.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_125409.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We complimented the gentlemen on his beautifully soothing voice and explained that if there was an audio book narrated by him, we would buy it instantly.\u00a0 The gentleman started laughing, became abashed and was completely taken by surprise. His mannerisms reminded us both of the Bashful dwarf from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_115819.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_123357.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_120320.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We ended up chatting with him for a good while talking about how Kansas City has changed over the course of his life, places to go see on the road trip and about the art in the galleries.\u00a0 We were able to learn more about the pieces, as if on a one-on-one tour, and we went on an art hunt to find his favorite piece in the whole place.\u00a0 He was absolutely wonderful and extremely humble.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>See Ya\u2019ll Later\nKansas City</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Completing the art museum in the early afternoon, we made\nour way out of town towards Wichita, KS. \nThe drive was full of farm fields, gentle rolling hills and a lot of\nland that was recently control burned. \nBlack soot and ash stretched for as far as the eye could see.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_132246.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Hungry little Chad eating celery with my homemade tzatziki sauce</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>I routed the map to hit a Costco in Wichita and we found ourselves in a pleasant little retirement community on the outskirts of town.\u00a0 So, I may have hit the wrong button.\u00a0 But, it was a pleasant stroll through a community and we did find our way to Costco eventually.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_185216.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_185206.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_185213.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_195626.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Once there around 6 p.m., we were ravenous since we only had\nveggies and coffee all day. Rotisserie\nchicken in hand, we made camp for the night in the back of the Costco parking\nlot next to some pleasant-looing greenery. \nWe devoured the bird until it was reduced to a pile of bones and munched\non carrots to clean our teeth. One of\nthe desk legs made a civilized table. \nDinner for two - $8. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/kc-coffee-conversations/20190403_190003.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2><strong>Night Night</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Now better trained on sleeping arrangements, we were able to access the trunk of the car, pull out our gear and put away items without even having to get out of the car. Stealth mode activated. The weather was warm, in the mid 50s, and wonderful for sleeping. </p>\n\n<p>We did see our first bug, but it wasn\u2019t anything that would bite. By far, this has been the best place for sleeping. I joked saying we should make the trip about seeing a Costco in every state, which then Chad replied with shaking his head. Ok, so maybe it wasn\u2019t my best idea, but it\u2019s a great idea for sleeping!</p>",

    "content": "<h2><strong>Good Morning Wichita</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Day 4: It rained during the night apparently? I was out cold and didn\u2019t notice I was getting damp.\u00a0 When we sleep in the car, we crack the windows a little to allow air flow in because there are two humans inside a small space and Chad steals my air at night! So a little of the rain made its way on to my sleeping bag. Thanks Costco for your parking lot! It was cozy.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_080700.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_080738.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_083009.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>All cleaned up at a local gas station, Chad and I wandered around Wichita. While Chad drives, I peek at the GPS and narrate what we are passing. It\u2019s very helpful! There was a cool looking shopping center (old bricked building) that I was interested in walking around and told Chad, \u201cWe should go walk this little area, it looks cute.\u201d To which Chad replied with a smirk on his face, evil grin, and eyebrows raised, \u201cWalk it with your eyes!\u201d. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_100301.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_100607.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_100620.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_100850.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_101307.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>It was a little chilly, and to prove his point, Chad rolled the windows completely down and continued to drive through the scenery as if it was a hot 90 degree day. \u201cWhat lovely weather we are having. Do you still want to go for a walk outside?\u201d As I am completely froze out, but not wanting to give in, I stubbornly joked back saying I did. Jokingly exasperated, the windows came up and we agreed to start heading out of town towards Oklahoma City. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Bloggin\u2019 on the Road</strong></h2>\n\n<p>With a nice 2.5 hour drive (give or take) until the next big city, I was able to set up the desk and pound away at the keys for a bit. Until, I really had to pee. It\u2019s always in the most inconvenient time. Looking around, there was nothing but random shacks here and there, wide country fields intermixed with what looked like \u201cout in the boondocks\u201d homes/junk yards/littered yards/overgrown vegetation. </p>\n\n<p>\"Chad I need to pee!\" </p>\n\n<p>He never seems to agree with my bladder. With that Oh My God look on his face, he turned slowly towards me to say, \u201clook around and let your body know it\u2019s not an appropriate time!\u201d Fast forward about 25 minutes (which felt like hours), vvvaallllaaa, we made it to the only gas station between Wichita and Oklahoma on the toll-free road. This is why tolls are a privilege. They get pee place opportunities.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Welcome to Oklahoma</strong></h2>\n\n<p>MMMM, the smell of fresh Oklahoma\u2026.skunk. When we hit the Oklahoma boarder line, we immediately smelled skunk. Chad, witty little thing he is, foreshadowed that the skunk symbolized we may have some stinky adventures coming our way. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_115143.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2><strong>Settled for the Ride</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Bladders empty, we hit the toll free half of I35. Weaving between fields that had a hint of new green and rolled in hilly waves for miles, we saw our first long horn calves of the trip with itty bitty little horns. </p>\n\n<p>We rolled into the outskirts of Oklahoma City and stopped at the visitor\u2019s center. Now prepped with the knowledge of free parking and where to walk around downtown, we were able to snag a front row parking spot at Bass Pro Shop. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Bricktown Exploration\n\u2013 Walking Style</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Katie finally gets to go on a backpacking walk! Because it\u2019s nice outside, a balmy 70 degrees, we are wicked hot. Following a little water canal, that led us through a very scenic setting with brick buildings lining both sides of the water. Shops, cafes, restaurants, a movie theater, Sonic Headquarters, mini golf and canal boat rides are just some of the places that littered the walk.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_133630.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_134028.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_1340391.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_134155.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_1342121.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_134509.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Our mission was to find a coffee shop to make some adjustments to the blog and get the lay of the land. We hunted all throughout the Bricks and finally came across <a href=\"https://www.allaboutcha-cafe.com/\">All About Cha</a>. The \u201cCoffee is cheaper than therapy\u201d window cling said it all. Once inside, we realized it was a Korean tea and coffee house with options for all varieties of drinks. (if you wanted food, you could have yummy looking sushi rolls and breakfast dishes). SUPER awesome tea. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_141214.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_141309.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_151609.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2><strong>Downtown Oklahoma\nCity</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Stretching our legs, we walked up and down the business streets. Towering skyscrapers, shiny buildings, old brick and stone were our friends for a while. We then walked the <a href=\"https://oklahomacitynationalmemorial.org/visit/\">Oklahoma National Memorial</a> for the bombing that took place in 1995 and wandered the grounds. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_151903.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_152028.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_152333.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_152444.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_1524581.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_152610.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_153533.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_155146.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_155303.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_155403.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The walking led to greenery and we found ourselves in a botanical garden. There were little flowers and color everywhere! Now we are hungry for some sustenance; the only food we have had today has been the left-over carrots from dinner and tea. Back in Bricktown over the canal, here was a taco place.

The stadium happened to be only a few blocks away from us. There was no way we were going to be able to move the car out of the front row and into the back for camping now. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_1905061.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_190657.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_192958.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_195336.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>There were no spots available for hours! Which means no\nprepping for bed or sleeping\u2026 Our bedtime usually begins when the sun is going\ndown and we are fast asleep around 8:30 p.m. to get up when the sun arrives. Not tonight. </p>\n\n<p>To kill some time, we adventured through Bass Pro and chatted with the older gentleman running the entrance. He shared that the water canal was made because there was a lot of water runoff in the city and it would inevitably flow through Bricktown in a stinky mess. So, they redesigned the entire space to look like a canal, added treatments to the water, and created a destination point with nature all around and shops. He laughed because tons of people think it\u2019s the nicest little place, but, it\u2019s where the stinky water runs out and they offer boat rides through it. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_1749091.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>He also mentioned the reason why Oklahoma City is called the \u2018<a href=\"http:// https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php\">Sooners</a>\u2019. It was during the <a href=\"https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php\">Land Run of 1889</a> and there were settlers who snuck out at night, staked their land claim in piles of rocks. The next morning after the land run started, they went straight to file their land claim ahead of everyone else. Super illegal, but they did it anyway, and became known as Sooners. They went sooner rather than later! :)</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Take Me OUT of the Ball Game</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Exhausted and way past our bedtime, we said \u2018screw it\u2019 and made camp in the front row of the Bass Pro Shop. This time, we hung a blanket across the passenger side of the car (the side that faces the road and walkways), stuffed a sleeping bag into the front windshield and piled a few things in the back window of the car. When viewed from the outside, you couldn't see in at all. Beautiful.</p>\n\n<p>Once asleep, we were suddenly woken by fireworks exploding from the stadium. My heart was pounding as I bolted out of a deep sleep. They were pretty and I had a direct view in my reclined position. It was the comfiest fireworks show I had ever been to!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_175011.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_175051.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/bricktown-canals/20190404_181933.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Now, floods of people started to come back to their cars. BEEP, BEEP, BEEP sounded the car alarm in front of us. Chad, dead asleep, darted straight up for our keys thinking it was our car. A loud group of people walked up the alarming car and finally shut the noise off. UGH. Chad is ill tempered. lol.</p>\n\n<p>In a small voice, \"um, Chad? I have to pee?\" </p>\n\n<p> Again, with that Oh My God look on his face, he turned slowly towards me to say, \u201cYou have to pee? Now? How? Where? Oh my gosh! I have to drive somewhere?! NOOOO!\u201d :/ </p>\n\n<p>We moved the car to a nice little nature space in the center of the Bass Pro Shop and reset camp. I was able to enjoy nature first hand hiding in the bushes. All set for sleep now! Hotter than sin, we went to bed sweating. Better luck next time! </p>",

    "content": "<h2><strong>Leaf Blowing & Lawn Maintenance</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Day 5: After having an eventful night with the local baseball game and patrons in the parking lot of the Bass Pro Shop, we slept in late (8 a.m.).\u00a0 Mind cloudy from the lack of good sleep, the sounds of the lawn care crew for Bass Pro merged into my dreams.\u00a0 Suddenly realizing the noise was getting closer, I woke up and heard someone leaf blowing under and around the car.\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s what you get when you park right next to the nature feature.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_074558.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190404_195336.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_074641.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The sun was up, warm and our make-shift blanket window covers created a tent-like atmosphere. It was super cozy! It was so peaceful until the birds returned to their homes in the hedges and trees. Squawking, screaming little things! </p>\n\n<p>If the birds were turned into little cartoons, it would have sounded like a war out there. The birds would have been yelling at each other, stealing food and supplies, marking their territory, yelling for their mates, etc. It was not the peaceful song birds that I was hoping for. Dawning some ear plugs, I went back to sleep. Chad continued to lay there motionless in his seat, obviously ignoring the racket.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Korean Tea For Two</strong></h2>\n\n<p>To get the\nblogging out of the way in the morning, Chad and I walked back to the Korean\nTea place, All About Cha, to snag some Wifi and good tea. The same guy that was working yesterday also\nhelped us pick out a really tasty \u2018garden party\u2019 blend (sweet taste from all of\nthe different flowers used) and an oolong tea (earthy green, yuummmm). Chad used his laptop for the first time on\nthe trip and caught up on some reading while I blogged. We\nspent the morning there until around noon and packed up to meet a friend in\nDallas.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_085428.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_085414.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_121238.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_121252.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2><strong>Sardines Please</strong></h2>\n\n<p>With the car\nloaded up, we continued on I35 south. Breakfast\nand lunch were satisfied with cutie tangerines, bananas and sardines. Yes, sardines. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_135730.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Side story: I\ngrew up hunting deer with my family in northern Minnesota and when you would get\na deer, you could finally indulge in can of sardines (as in, this was a treat). So, I\u2019ve kind of always like canned fish and it\u2019s\nsuper yummy. Chad likes the sardines\ntoo, but also because they have a high source of omega-3 fatty acids and it\u2019s very\ngood for your brain.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_134810.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_135523.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Anyways, we drove and drove. Eventually, we started the listen to the audio book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Human-Nature-Robert-Greene/dp/0525428143.\">The Laws of Human Nature</a>.</em> We have been reading the hard copy and was pleasantly surprised to see this title pop up in Audible. Now we can listen and pause anytime to discuss the content. It\u2019s super nice since you don\u2019t have to wait for the other person to finish a section of the book to go over it.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Traffic & Drivers are Nuts</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We were only\nan hour away from Dallas and the 4-lane traffic is hardly moving. What in the world? It\u2019s only 3:30 p.m.! The trip into the city was long, hot and\nslow. </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cChad, I have to pee\u2026.and I know this is a bad time.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Chad turned\nhis head slowly with his jaw dropped and stared at me. While trying to hold in a smirk he commented,\n\u201clook around and tell your body it\u2019s not a good place to go. What did you drink?\nI didn\u2019t see you drink anything?!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Smiling, I\nsaid we better find a place soon, because when we get closer to Dallas, there\nwon\u2019t be easy locations to pull off to. In\na teasing, grumbling way, we made it off of the freeway about 20 minutes later\nand backtracked the way we came. \u201cChad, why\nare we going backwards?\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to a special pee place. You don\u2019t deserve the grimy gas station bathrooms.\u201d </p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Waiting patiently,\nChad looped and looped around the Texas highway infrastructure and pulled into\na Cracker Barrel. \u201cHere you are, a pleasant place for you to pee.\u201d We had just talked about how I had never been\nto one (that I remember anyway) and now I can say I have. Thanks lol.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_153113.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The remaining drive was for sure long because of how slow we were going. I decided to play the song <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch\">Send Me on My Way</a> </em> and started dancing to it all crazy-like. Magically, the traffic seemed to be moving faster! So, we played the song twice and set the intention for traffic to get going! We were finally moving. \ud83d\ude0a \"I would walk 500 miles..\" is not the right song for this moment.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGMabBGydC0\n</div></figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Strolling Downtown Dallas</strong></h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_195301.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Snagging parking in a parking garage, we met up with our friend Nnamdi and proceeded to tour the streets. There happened to be an art fair going on, so we walked the strips of booths while catching up. It\u2019s been over four years since we have seen him and it\u2019s ironic Dallas was also the place we hung out last time. Dallas brings people together! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_180103.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_181046.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_193624.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_194409.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_194540.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_195239.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>After slurping up some ramen, we walked all over the place. The temperature was in the high 80s and dropping as the sun went down. We found art sculptures, water fountains, explored streets and even hopped onto an old-school trolley. Once dark, we made our way to Nnamdi\u2019s apartment and chatted late into the evening. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_195048.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_195804.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_201346.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/next-stop-dallas/20190405_201553.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2><strong>First Shower Since Monday</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Cleaning up and taking a shower felt so refreshing. Granted, Chad and I took care to make sure we removed odors from ourselves with wet wipes for sure twice a day, it can\u2019t beat a shower. Thank you Nnamdi! </p>\n\n<p>As for clothing, we have been mindful to only use a few outfits while traveling to keep them clean. Now, we can scrub them up too and get ready for a new week! Nnamdi had a blow-up mattress for us and we were able to lay flat to rest for the first time all week. </p>\n\n<p>Lights from\nthe buildings lit the skyline, sirens continued to blare, and loud conversations\nwafted through the windows. But, it didn\u2019t\nbother us and we were soon fast asleep.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 6: Sleeping inside a building instead of a car was wonderful. It was a pleasure being able to walk to the bathroom right away in the morning instead of having to clean up the sleeping fort.\u00a0 Ah, the comforts of civilization.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_114645.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_090150.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_114721.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad and\nNnamdi entertained themselves through discussion while I started worked on the\nblog. Grey rain clouds began to roll in\nand shortly the room darkened as the first crack of lightening struck the\nsky. Sheets of rain pelted the little\npeople ten stories below and the city noises damped as they were covered up by the\nnatural noise of rain hitting the windows. \nGood thing we didn\u2019t adventure out in the morning on foot.</p>\n\n<p>The rain\nbegan to diminish and the honking horns, sirens and loud conversations of\npassing people began to drift back. Chad\nand Nnamdi left to walk to a local weekend market t snag breakfast, with the\nintension of bringing me back a bite to eat while I finish up the blog. This\nwas the first time I have been alone for at least five days and the silence was\nrestful. </p>\n\n<p>When the guys\ncame back, they didn\u2019t have any yummies to share. Instead, they devised a plan for us to go to\nan all-we-can-eat Indian buffet. YUM. We\nhopped in our car and zig-zagged through downtown Dallas to reach the suburbs\nhosting the restaurant. I guess this\nplace was voted best Indian restaurant in 2015 and the food was delish.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_145339.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2><strong>Mansion Villa</strong></h2>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_152219.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_152329.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_154158.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_155152.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_155804.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_161327.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>To help our\nfull tummies digest, we drove around the suburbs surrounding Dallas and found\nourselves in mansion villa. Street after\nstreet of large homes passed by and we were amazed by the varieties of architecture.\nSome of homes even had signs in their yard saying they had armed guards on the\nproperty. Wowza, that\u2019s really intense\nif you think you need guards on your property. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_151316.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_151347.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_152028.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_152105.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_152120.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_152137.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/lightening-dallas/20190406_152219.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We also made a trip to Barnes and Nobel and snooped around the book shelves.

    "content": "<p>Day 7: Happy\nSunday! Today marks the end of the first\nweek of the road trip and we are holding up great. Chad and I spent a second day in Dallas with\nour friend Nnamdi exploring the local farmer\u2019s market. This place had booths and food places indoors\nand outdoors, making the grounds expansive. The sky was foggy, almost as if it\nwould rain any minute, and over 70 degrees. \nIt was perfect walking weather.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_012017.jpg\" /><p>It was\nlooking a little rainy and cold, but once outside it was crazy humid. My hair poof-ed\nup into springy, frizzy curls the moment we walked out the door. That\u2019s the great thing about warm weather,\nyou don\u2019t have to worry about using volumizing hair products! Chad\u2019s hair also has started to curl but has\nroped it back into the tight bun to control the escaping strands.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_121929.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve we only had to walk a few blocks to the market. From Nnamdi\u2019s current living space he can\nwalk to grocery stores, food shops, the farmer\u2019s market, entertainment and has\naccess to public transportation. It\u2019s a\nreally cool set up and there are little areas for green space on many of the\ncorners. So far, the water fountains\nhave been my favorite.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Hunting for Food</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We all\nwandered the rows of the farmer\u2019s market searching for little yummies. Nnamdi was the first to find a little (and I\nmean super little) specialty vegan taco drizzled with unique sauces. He said it was good, but it went by wayyyyyy\ntoo fast.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_122010.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I snuck away\nand found a fried taco. I wasn\u2019t really\nsure what a fried taco was, but after further observation, it had basic taco fillings\nand was stuffed into a fried hard shell. \nWith the hot shell, the ingredients were stuffed inside and the flaps\nfolded to encase everything. Huh, well,\nit was good but also tasted like a taco I could have made at home. Better luck next time!</p>\n\n<p>Chad remained\nneutral like Switzerland and didn\u2019t hop into the food frenzie right away. He was searching for the ultimate food item\nthat would blow everything out of the water. \nWe soon found these items back inside the indoor market.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_122152.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_122721.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_123206.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_124440.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_124544.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_125459.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We walked up to\na vendor who was positioned outside of a little boutique store selling fresh\nveggies, candles and canned goods. How\nodd? Why would there be a little station\noutside of the boutique store? There was\nan older gentleman standing behind small tables filled with what looked like homemade\nfood dishes. I knew this was the place\nto be. </p>\n\n<p>An eclectic\nman wearing a Patagonia t-shirt drew me in right away. Curious about everything in front of him, I\nasked about the stew pot boiling on a hot surface in front of him. He spoke brokenly, in a thick accent, about\nthe boiling bean stew which lead him to describing the pans of food in front of\nhim. Hook and sinker. I so needed to try\nthe dish with spinach, leak and spices stuffed inside the filo (the flakey pastry\ndough found in Mediterranean cooking). Man, oh man was it good! Thank you Patagonia Chef!</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_130608.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>So good, that\nwhen we made it to the end of the booths, we turned around and headed back to\nthe Patagonia Chef for more yummies. This\ntime, Chad and I tried the eggplant lasagna and one dolmathakia. The gentleman mentioned that he wakes up at 3\na.m. to start making these items and everything he cooks is intentionally made to\nhelp cleanse/nourish the body. With a bowl\nof fresh olives at his side, he painted the dolmathakia with fresh olive\noil and a pinch of spices.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_125957.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_130618.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_131231.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_150214.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>When we paid\nfor the food inside the boutique, the bearded man behind the counter mentioned Patagonia\nChef used to be a well-off shoe designer and that over the course of his life\nhas owned many restaurants. Now for fun,\nhe sets up shop outside of their boutique and sells his homemade food every so\noften. When the Patagonia Chef isn\u2019t in\ntown, he\u2019s out in California making food for well-to-do people who appreciates\nhis talent. What a crazy back story on\nthe very good homemade food we experienced.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Scooter Time</strong></h2>\n\n<p>After\nnibbling on some local yummies, we started the walk back to Nnamdi\u2019s apartment\nand Nnamdi said it\u2019s time to try the electric scooters. Back in Minnesota and North Dakota, we have\nbikes available for people to use for getting around the city. But, ever since Kansas Chad and I have only\nseen scooters for people to use. They\ncan be found literally anywhere because they liter the sidewalks, parking lots,\nalleys, etc. </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/9OiAclo9\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>Paying for the\nservice with an app, it unlocks the scooter and tracks the amount of time it\u2019s\nused. Nnamdi unlocked one and I was able\nto go for my first electric scooter ride. \nNo accidents! We all tried and\ntook turns driving it up and down the sidewalk. \nIt would be helpful for getting across the downtown area!</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/hfzlHJpw\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2><strong>Relaxation & Research</strong></h2>\n\n<p>After our\nafternoon adventure to the market, we walked around outside and found a few\nmore water features tucked away in public green spaces. Once home, Chad and Nnamdi spent the\nafternoon gaming together while I researched national parks along the east\ncoast to prep for the upcoming cities. Looks\nlike we might be taking part in a lot of battlefield memorials, national\nseashores, and wildlife reserves along the coast.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_142021.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_144423.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_150117.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2><strong>Chinese Take Out</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Growing up in\nthe country, I always thought it was fun watching Seinfeld when Jerry and his\nfriends would order take out to eat in his New York City apartment. The concept of going downstairs and grabbing\na bite to eat from the local shops and retreating to your apartment to chow\ndown has intrigued me. (To this day, I\nhaven\u2019t really experienced this sort of living.) So today was the day! Chad and I ordered Chinese food and had it\ndelivered to the massive skyscraper apartment (the restaurant was wayyyy to far\nto walk).</p>\n\n<p>When the\ndelivery person called, we both went downstairs to make sure the other person\ndidn\u2019t get locked out of the building by mistake. Chad went out on the street while I posted\ninside. As Chad disappeared down the sidewalk,\na man came in holding a food bag and was approaching me. I started to tell the man that Chad went\noutside to look for him, that he has the money for the tip and if the delivery man\nwouldn\u2019t mind waiting. </p>\n\n<p>The guy, whom\nI though was the delivery man because of the food bag, actually was a resident\nin the apartment we were staying at and all he wanted to do was get through the\ndoor I was posting at. SUPER\nAWKWARD. The guy started laughing and\nChad walked in with our real food bag.</p>\n\n<p>We all rode\nthe elevator together back up to our apartments and were laughing about how the\nguy thought he had walked in a on drug deal because I mentioned Chad was\noutside with the money. Oops. </p>\n\n<p>The Chinese food was pretty good \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t order it again, but it was good for the moment.\u00a0 The rest of the night was spend watching a movie on Netflix and finishing a couple rounds of gaming. We were able to wash our clothes and I took time to do some yoga while waiting for the cycles to be done. Awesome stretchy goodness. Especially now that we are stuck in a car most of the time, a stretching routine needs to be implemented.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/scootering/20190407_191832.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p> In the morning, Chad and I would depart from Dallas and head to Austin to meet up with one of my friends.\u00a0 So long Dallas! </p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 8: Farewell Dallas! But, before leaving the\nparking garage the windows needed to be washed badly. Hall the car is a filthy little bugger. Chad and I worked on scrubbing off the\nremains of our Minnesotan winter weather and had also applied Rain-X. It\u2019s spring, so there could be rainy weather\nalong the coast. </p>\n\n<p>Next stop,\nAustin. I have a friend who recently\nmoved there and we arranged to meet up for dinner. The three-hour car ride from\nDallas went by quickly. With each passing mile, the sun beamed down hotter and\nhotter. We were being cooked alive (or\nit felt like it), because the car dash read over 80 degree! Holy catfish, that\u2019s hot for these northern\npale-skinned folks!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Blind Google Maps</strong></h2>\n\n<p> When we were pulling into the outskirts of Austin, it was my turn to drive. Somehow, I had made it an entire week without driving lol. Awesome, right? Crazy Texas traffic, watch out for me!</p>\n\n<p>While I drove into the city, Chad was very quiet. He then presented me with the phone and said, \u201cfollow the map!\u201d. He had researched and mapped out places to see in succession without spilling the beans as to where we were going. How cool! It was like a little scavenger hunt without knowing what you were looking for or where you were heading to.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Mount Bonnell at Covert Park</strong></h2>\n\n<p>To get to the first stop, we weaved in and out of very hilly neighborhoods. Chad had found a little hiking trail on a rock face bordering the Colorado River. I parked the car and we stretched our legs climbing the rocky staircase to the top. What a sight. The river was expansive and made the homes on the shoreline look really small. But, upon closer inspection, these homes were massive mansions along the water front. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_162500.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_163022.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_162727.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_163031.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_163807.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>When the trail\nended, we turned around to take it back up and I started to hop around on the stone-spewed\npath. This led to jogging/hopping the rocks\nall the way up hill to the place we\u2019d come in. \nThe heat was extremely noticeable when we stopped and it had felt great\nto move again. Next stop, somewhere!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Zilker Botanical Garden</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The second\nplace Chad found was a beautiful botanical garden tucked into a hill and\nsurrounded by massive trees. The guy at\nthe gate even gave us the local\u2019s discount for parking ($2), thank you Sir, and\nthe park stayed open longer than what the sign read out front. We were obviously meant to be here and soak\nin the greenery.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_170637.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_170727.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_171040.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_171126.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_171157.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_171236-1.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The different garden spaces were so refreshing after just having spent the weekend in the concrete jungle of Dallas. Who knew Austin had so many green spaces? My favorite sections were the Asian gardens and the section where all of the plants looked like something out of Jurassic Park. </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/1dV2fGmT\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_171236.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_171713.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_171935.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_172058.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_172125.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_172137.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The aromas of all of the blooming flowers was thick in the air, bees and bugs were humming around and it was absolutely pleasant to be a part of it. Having grown up on a farm and spent numerous amounts time gardening (flowers and veggies), I have a tendency to touch the plants as I pass. Side note: I often find myself plucking sprouting trees and weeds while in public, I\u2019m working on it lol.</p>\n\n<p>While\nreaching my hand out to touch a plant, I asked Chad \u201cwhat\u2019s that one?\u201d for like\nthe millionth time.</p>\n\n<p>Chad looked at the plant, then to me while smiling, and back to the plant while light-heartedly saying, \"it\u2019s a 'don\u2019t-touch-that' plant.\u201d</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_172251-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I hadn\u2019t\nrealized, but I had literally had my hands brushing leaves, branches, petals,\nyou name it the entire time we had been walking. Who knows if I would have accidentally\nbrushed a stray itch weed, harm a plant by mistake, or touch something I wasn\u2019t\nsupposed to. Just a little nature lady,\nhmm??</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_172813.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_173828.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_174138.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_174155.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_174640.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_175055.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We dinked\naround walking the gardens and wrapped up around the time the park was\nclosing. It was exactly what we needed\nafter a week on the road to recoup and relax.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Tacos on Barton</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Time was flying and dinner was approaching, so the surprise museums on the list would have to wait until tomorrow. I drove us around and around looking at the local spaces and used the time to catch up with some friends over a phone call. By the time our conversations wrapped up, it was time to head to dinner.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_192039.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>My long time\nfriend Brianna and manfriend Nick met us at a local taco shop and we were able\nto catch up. We sat outside, enjoyed the\nhot weather and lost track of time while telling about our latest adventures. It was so good to see them and talked about\nmaybe seeing Brianna in the morning for coffee. \nIf it was meant to be, then it will be. \nTasty tacos and quality conversations are the best.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/austin-texas-is-green/20190408_205648.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2><strong>Sweaty Rest</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Chad and I retired for the evening at the local Costco parking lot which was decked out in greenery. They had trees littering the parking lot, making it feel more sheltered and homier. We parked the car near a clump of trees right off the highway and made camp. </p>\n\n<p>The night hadn\u2019t cooled off yet and we were still roasting. No blankets, no sleeping bag, no extra clothing fabric (as much as you can spare without being indecent) and no air flow. That\u2019s a lot of no\u2019s. If we opened the windows too much, all the little bugs would come in. We will have to start putting up our bug-proof window screens at night.</p>\n\n<p>I cuddled up on my pillow palace chair and Chad nestled into his space for rest. Night night Austin, your greenery has made for a great day with great company.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 9: \u00a0Pro tip #432 - don\u2019t park the car facing a freeway or loud street, because you won\u2019t sleep well at all. Kind of a no brainer, right? \u00a0Chad and I had parked in an Austin, TX Costco lot in the back, which happened to be near a freeway.\u00a0 The loud cars continued all night long and I even ended up sleeping with ear plugs.\u00a0 It helped, but I could still hear everything. </p>\n\n<ul class=\"is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_065839.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_075241.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure></li></ul>\n\n<p>I awoke many times to the car shaking for just an instant and I thought there was something outside rubbing on the car or someone trying to get in.\u00a0 Not good!\u00a0 I realized later that whenever Chad rolled around in his seat, it would shake the car and I couldn\u2019t hear him rustling. The ear plugs really work for little noises haha.\u00a0 The coast is clear, no creepies or animals trying to break in!</p>\n\n<p>After the sun rose, I started to work on the blog in my pillow palace seat while Chad continued to rest.\u00a0 Everything was going well for about 20 minutes and then the tacos from last night came back with vengeance.\u00a0 Gurgle. Gurgle.\u00a0 Uh oh. \u00a0 </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cChad, wake up.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got to go and it\u2019s urgent. Like, 'I-need-a-stack-of-wet-wipes' urgent and that tree out there won\u2019t do. Pack up your things!\u201d\u00a0 </p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Groggy, and basically still asleep, Chad readjusted his seat methodically. I was moving 90 miles an hour shifting pillows and gear to get myself as ready as possible for a quick escape out of the car.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>Chad drove to a hotel right around the corner and I bolted as calmly as possible inside the entrance. Ba-boom!\u00a0 So, maybe the fried food in the taco didn\u2019t agree with me and it should be avoided?\u00a0 Absolutely! </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Hedge Hog Visit </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Feeling much like myself again, I set the GPS for us to visit my friend Brianna at her place.\u00a0 Last night at dinner, she mentioned that she and Nick had two little hedgehogs at home.\u00a0 They were a must see and their place happened to be in walking distance of a coffee shop, which made for a grand morning adventure.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_092545.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_092546.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_092602.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Henry the\nhedge hog was super cute! He had surgery\nthe week before because his eye fell out (I guess they have shallow eye\nsockets??) and had it removed. Now Henry is a one-eyed fella who has the cutest\nlittle sniffer nose and nibbles on your fingers. So cute!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Coffee & Black Birds</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Brianna, Chad and I walked to their local grocery store to share some coffee and conversation. The vibe of the place came across similar to a Minnesota Trader Joe\u2019s and there were people everywhere.\u00a0 We snagged four drinks to share \u2013 a fresh watermelon and matcha tea drink, a regular cold press coffee, an iced vanilla latte and a specialty coffee drink with chocolate and a hot spice.\u00a0 After tasting and voting on them, the regular cold press was the least favorite and the spicy concoction was the winner.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_094050.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_094052.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_095652.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_095754.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We placed ourselves outside on the patio and proceeded to chat from early morning until late in the afternoon. \u00a0\u00a0The caffeine from the drinks totally took their toll on us as we covered a crazy amount of topics \u2013 below lists just a few!</p>\n\n<ul><li>Brianna\u2019s study abroad to South Africa and her stories of bareback horse riding on the beach, being trapped in the mountains at night, the animals and people she met while visiting for five months.</li><li>Chad and Katie\u2019s west coast road trip adventures</li><li>The physiology of micro expressions, leading by example, body language, understanding people\u2019s emotions, gut bacteria, fasting, cavities, etc. </li><li>Future places to travel and suggestions on places to see in the world</li></ul>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_111148.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_135538.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Throughout our conversation time, there were dive bombing black birds that would come out of no where and act like they were going to peck your eyes out.\u00a0 It\u2019s like a scene from Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056869/\">The Birds</a></em>! There were even times where we had to fend off lunches left on the table while the owner went to grab napkins.\u00a0 Those tiny little vultures wouldn\u2019t quit!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Food Hunting in the South</strong></h2>\n\n<p>After realizing almost four hours have passed in caffeinated conversation, we decided to tour the grocery store.\u00a0 This wasn't just any regular grocery store.\u00a0 There\u2019s outdoor seating for the restaurant and coffee shop bustling inside, chair massages, and unique winding paths within the store that open up to different sections based on their climate needs. </p>\n\n<p>The produce section had its own door to go through and we walked into a massive market.\u00a0 It\u2019s like Whole Foods on steroids. But, the food prices were pretty affordable!</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_140238.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Brianna recommended trying kumquats, prickly pear fruit and a golden apple.\u00a0 Say what?\u00a0 Chad said he thought that \u2018kumquat\u2019 was considered a cuss word and not the name of a fruit.\u00a0 Reality shattered.\u00a0 The really cool part about the produce section was the automatic labeling system available.\u00a0 After selecting a fruit/veggie, you weight it and print out a sku sticker for the checkout person to scan.\u00a0 How convenient is that? We need those in Minnesota!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_140659.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_140900.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_141134.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_141815.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2><strong>Nature Walk Causalities </strong></h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_094222.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>After wrapping up the grocery exploration, we started to make the loop back to Brianna\u2019s apartment around a little pond.\u00a0 There were wild flowers growing all over the grass, including little Blue Bonnets.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_143339.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_143346.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_203134.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_142847.jpg\" /><p>There was a massive tree in middle of the nature area (it had earned the <em>Tree of the Year</em> award apparently) and we went to stand under it.\u00a0 While looking around, I was hit from above with a splat of black bird poop.\u00a0 Casualties included my left side shoulder, thigh and calf.\u00a0 What a blow!\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_143048.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_143043.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2><strong>Fruit Taste Testing</strong></h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_142722.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Back at Brianna\u2019s place, we cooled down from the afternoon heat by trying out the different fruits we purchased.\u00a0 The kumquat was for sure the most surprising flavor!\u00a0 Chad and I have never had one before and we popped the little orange-looking things into our mouths.</p>\n\n<p>One bite down, and the world exploded into a sour flavor causing me to pucker up like a baby trying a lemon for the first time.\u00a0 Who knew it would be sour!\u00a0 Continuing to chew, the sour instantly went away and was taken over by the ultimate sweetness.\u00a0 They are so good!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_144048.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_144409.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_144801.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The prickly pear was peeled and then cut into chunks to share.\u00a0 They have a very subtle taste with the texture resembling the less-flavorful part of a watermelon rind and are littered with seeds, similar to a pomegranate.\u00a0 After having just tried the kumquat, this fruit was extremely tasteless in comparison.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>The golden\napple tasted like eating a yellow pear, with the crunch of an apple and sweetness\nof coconuts/bananas. It was the craziest\napple I have ever eaten. Brianna\nmentioned this variety of apple doesn\u2019t go brown after cutting it and has\ntested this theory to make sure it was true.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Farewell, Dear!</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The coffee\nencounter truly lasted longer than expected, but we wouldn\u2019t trade it for all\nof the museums in Austin. Thanks Brianna\nfor your company and it was great catching up with you. See you later when we come back for a visit \ud83d\ude0a </p>\n\n<h2><strong>South Congress Avenue</strong></h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_161357.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Chad and I\ndrove to downtown Austin for a walk and to stretch our legs. We ended up walking the entire strip and\nmaking our way down to the Colorado river. \nWhile on our river walk, we worked on improving our walking form to\nminimize the jarring/stomping in our legs. \nNo more heel to toe walking! It\u2019s\nway easier to run on our toes like sprinters than it is to walk on our toes. Looks like there is room for improvements! Either way, we walked and walked trying out\ndifferent ways to place our feet on the ground based on previous research we\nhave done. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_161728.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_162651.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_164530.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_165854.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_170210.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_171911.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Finishing in a large walking loop, we packed up the car and drove out to have dinner at the <a href=\"https://888panasian.business.site/\">888 Pan Asian Restaurant</a>. Chad and I had stumbled across this place during lunch for an all-you-can-eat $10 lunch special when we came to Austin back in October for a long-distance rifle shooting class (side story at the bottom).\u00a0 We tried the panang curry and duck as well as the lemongrass vermicelli noodles with chicken.\u00a0 NUMMY.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20190409_185239.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Our sleeping space for the night was a few hours out of town towards Houston at a Cracker Barrel.\u00a0 The night was hot again and Chad had the idea of freezing us out with the AC all the way there so that when we parked, we would stay cool while falling asleep. It worked pretty well! Night night!</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Long Distance Rifle Shooting Side Note:</strong>\u00a0 </h3>\n\n<p>Chad and I ventured down to Austin, TX \u00a0in October 2018 to complete a four-day training on how to shoot a target at long distances.\u00a0 The course, held by <a href=\"https://www.accuracy1st.com/\">Accuracy 1st</a>, is designed to train military snipers and is offered to civilians as well. All classes are highly sought after and getting a class for two people can be tough since they fill up fast.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20181021_142232.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20181021_142218.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20181021_191615.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20181021_183803.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/southern-friends-trees-coffee/20181021_183833.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>After completing training, I was able to hit gongs set into the Texan rolling hills over 1200 meters away with a .308 and Chad (dealing with the setting sun and dark shadows) was able to get out to 1000 meters before the landscapes were unreadable.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>It was a great experience and the coolest thing ever was to pull the trigger, count out two or three Mississippi seconds and hear a \u2018ting!\u2019 at the far end of the range. </p>",

Stay clean you arm pits! </p></blockquote>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/houston/20190410_092255.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/houston/20190410_092335.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>During the\nhot evening, I wasn\u2019t able to fall asleep very well because of the heat. Let\u2019s start adjusting faster, Katie! Once asleep, I was out for the night. Chad was super groggy and bug-eyed when he\nwoke and I guess he woke up all night long to every little noise. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/houston/20190410_102919.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/houston/20190410_103406.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/houston/20190410_103949.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>On a positive\nnote, we needed to go to a wifi location for me to blog and that means juice to\nshock Chad back to functioning. We found\na little caf\u00e9 called Cafeza and spent the morning in their company.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Park & Gyros</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Early\nafternoon, we put ourselves back into the dry sauna car to go tour\nHouston. We have to remember to leave\nthe windows cracked just a little bit to let all of the super hot air escape. But, we could treat it like having our own\npersonal sauna on wheels and only sit in it for less than 20 minutes without\nstarting the vehicle. Side note: Chad and I would sauna almost everyday back\nhome at the gym and we kinda miss it.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/houston/20190410_135411.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Chad found a\nlocation for us to go walk around a park and I drove (the second time of the\ntrip, woot woot). When we drove by the\nintended park, it looked like a memorial and had little parking. We kept going and found a larger parking lot\na few miles up the road and the greenery spread in gentle hills within the\nlarge city.</p>\n\n<p>With a hangry Chad, I found a Mediterranean restaurant within walking distance and we took our gyros to go. Time for a picnic in the park! There was only one picnic table perfectly resting in shade calling our name. The gyro was refreshing and the Greek salad was awesome. We also tried a build-your-own-gyro dish with sauteed fresh veggies and chicken. It wasn\u2019t the best, but anything tastes good with the tzatziki sauce.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/houston/20190410_140310.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/houston/20190410_140319.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/houston/20190410_145527.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>\"Chad, this table looks like a sacrificial alter. Are you going to sacrifice me?\" </p></blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"/images/houston/20190410_145545.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<blockquote><p>\"Of course not, because then I would have to talk to myself the rest of drive home.\"</p></blockquote>\n\n<h2><strong>Houston Traffic</strong></h2>\n\n<p>I have a\nfriend, Vicky, who moved to Lake Jackson and we set it up to have dinner with\nher. It was getting later into the afternoon\nand she mentioned Houston traffic is really bad, especially with construction,\nand we had a hour to drive south. \nInstead of touring Houston, we thought it would be safe to start heading\nout before everyone started getting off work.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/houston/20190410_153021.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>It was only 3 p.m. and we were in stop and go traffic. The roads traveling around Houston were super congested, but it eased up the further south we went. We needed gas for the rest of the day trip and headed out to Costco. No sense not going to Costco, we've hit every fuel stop there and we don't want to break the streak!</p>\n\n<h2>Catching up on the Way to Fuel</h2>\n\n<p>While on the way to Costco, I called my brother to catch up and hear about his new truck. Sounds like he really likes it and was taking it for a car wash later that day!</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/houston/david-truck.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we are being reminded by friends of what's going on in Minnesota. SNOW and more SNOW! </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/houston/john-words.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"/images/houston/matt-done.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>Fueling Up</h2>\n\n<p>After fueling up, I thought it would be a great time to relieve myself before getting on the way. Chad thought otherwise! :) </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\"I'm so offended by your bladder, Katie. Your bladder is the most offending thing I have ever met.\"</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess I have to use the bathroom more than he does?! Obviously, I'm a lot more hydrated than he is???? Hopefully, I won't be banned from water.... ;) All geared up for the road and cleaned up, we made our way south towards Lake Jackson.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Lake Jackson with Vicky</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We pulled into the \u201cCity of Enchantment\u201d around 5 p.m. and met up with Vicky at her home. Her german shepherd Tzar greeted us and we chatted for a bit. It was cool to catch up and understand more about what she is doing now that college is done.</p>\n\n<p>The weather was warm, but not too humid. The neighborhoods were covered with greenery and large trees arching over the community roads. I even spotted the moss-like substance that hangs down from the southern trees and I realized the \u201cmoss\u201d is composed of what looks like to be a variety of air plants. </p>\n\n<p>Chad researched and found the hanging moss is called Small Ball Moss and it grows on larger plants. They are little air plants growing together, and eventually, hang down in large chains to look like swinging moss in the trees.</p>\n\n<p>We hopped in the car and met some of her co-workers for dinner at a local tex-mex restaurant. Chad and I shared a fajita and chimichanga while hearing more about the lives of the engineers </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/houston/20190410_1844430.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/houston/20190410_184500.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Time for Bed</h2>\n\n<p>In the morning, we'll head out to the east coast through Galveston.

      "2019 East Coast Road Trip"
    ],
    "tags": [],
    "content": "<p>Day 11: Today the east coast trip really begins! Chad and I rested in a Love\u2019s truck stop parking lot near Lake Jackson, Texas. We planned on heading to Galveston, Texas to get on a ferry that would take get us over to Louisiana. It\u2019s free, so why not?</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_072903.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We packed up our camping space (lol, we put the pillows and blankets in the trunk) and headed out. The countryside was full of crop fields and then it started to become industrial as we came across a few chemical plants. Massive pipes, tall metal towers, lights, and doodads littered the companies\u2019 grounds. Wowza. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Living on Stilts</strong></h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_091509.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Country fields soon turned into to marshes and swamp-like areas. We have made it to what I think is the bayou? As we came around a curve, we saw homes raised and built on stilts??? </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_091445.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_091447.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_091456.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_091824.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_092039.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_092419.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Homes were raised one or two stories high into the air and had their boats stored under their decks. Every home had access to the water and some were even completely surrounded by lapping tides. We took the next exit and drove through the streets to peek around. What a totally different lifestyle! They are preppin\u2019 for those hurricanes and high tides!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>High Sidewalks Downtown Galveston</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We made it\ninto Galveston and drove around to find a coffee shop in their downtown\nspace. We snagged a 2 hour parking spot\nfor free and I was pumped to get out of the car and make it to the restroom\nafter the morning drive. WAM! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_094648.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_094634.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_094626.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cUh, Chad? I can\u2019t get out of the car\u2026.because I just smacked the car door against the gutter\u2026\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Poor Jetta,\nhe did nothing to deserve that. There\nwas no damage (not sure how, I wacked it pretty good) and I crawled out the\ndriver\u2019s seat. Super oops.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Coffee & Comics</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Chad ordered one large regular coffee for us to share while I set up camp to blog. We took our time and detoured our creativity a little to design a few comics about winter photos we received from friends back home. (<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/2019/04/11/houston/\">Check out the last post to view the comics.</a>)</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_122852.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_122906.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_122925.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Why not\ninclude them? Our family and friends are\na part of our journey too! During the\nprocess of blogging and creating, I was pretty sure I only drank a few sips of\ncoffee. Chad downed the whole thing. Oh\nboy, Chad will be lit later!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>All Aboard the Ferry!</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Galveston was\na cute little beach town and you could tell that it thrived best off\ntourism. There were cute little shops, very\nold buildings, a large permanent carnival on stilts above the beach and the\nocean waves crashed onto the shore. It\nwas breezy, cloudy and humid. We finally\nsaw the ocean!</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_125307.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>First ocean view of the trip!</figcaption></figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_123017.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_124112.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_124200.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_125237.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We drove to the end of town and ducked into a side street directing the waiting line for the ferry. Filing in line, we arrived at the port and waited for the next available ferry. Chad and I watched as one of the two ferries had arrived with a load of cars. Huge semis, pick ups and cars came off in waves. Wow, who knew the semis could take the ferry too? Chad drove the car onto the deck and we squeezed into a spot near the railing. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_130205.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_125525.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_130521.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_130738.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>If we wanted to, we could get out of the car and go stand on the upper deck, but we chose to stay inside our car. Rolling the windows down and setting up a make-shift table in the middle console, we broke out game of Rummy while we crossed the little water puddle on the coast of Texas. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/screenshot_20190411-133418.png\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_132514.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Coastal\nDriving</h2>\n\n<p>The ferry ride didn\u2019t take more than 20 minutes? I really don\u2019t know, we weren\u2019t in a hurry and time doesn\u2019t seem to matter when you don\u2019t have a need to be somewhere. \ud83d\ude0a </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_162553.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Our next\ndestination was to head for Baton Rouge, Louisiana for dinner and rest. To get there, our only option was to take the\ncoastal road for a few hours until we hit the major highway. The coast was a mixture of grass lands,\nnature reserves, small communities of homes on stilts and little oil pumps\nthrown here and there.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_164323.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>Longest\nBridge Ever</h2>\n\n<p>Once on the main highway, it was smooth sailing for the next four hours. Chad and I switched driving after a pit stop and I took over. We passed through bayous and water-filled fields. We think they could be crawfish fields or rice paddies? </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_174523.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_181003.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The water started to get deeper and we found ourselves on a bridge. Oncoming traffic had their own bridge and there would be no u-turns. The land bridge lasted for over an hour driving while driving above the bayou below. Sometimes the middle section between the highways had open water and people were driving little fishing boats through the passage. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190412_075232.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>Time for a\nFish Boil</h2>\n\n<p>Chad and I haven\u2019t had crawfish so we plugged into the GPS Sammy\u2019s Grill. (Chad had been doing some research and looked for best place to have some southern delicacies.) We drove over a large arched bridge into Baton Rouge and pulled into Sammy\u2019s super full parking lot. We wandered inside hearing loud conversations, seeing kids running around and people relaxing for dinner.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_184510.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The waitress helped us order our first bucket of crawfish (4 lbs) and a buffalo shrimp po boy sandwich. She even showed us how to properly take a part the little fellas and the proper way to eat them. Don\u2019t forget to slurp out the juices from the upper body cavity and pull the meat out of the tail! Chad and I were covered in spicy juices from the boiling brine and were \"all-hands-on-deck\" working on devouring the massive platter of crawfish. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_183738.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_190001.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_190142.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_190521.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_190622.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_194809.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The po boy was like a fancy Subway sandwich. It was good and we are glad we tried it, but we don\u2019t really need to order it again (unless there is a delicacy recipe that we just HAVE to try). The crawfish was also good and kinda fun to pull a part, but it would be more enjoyable to have one lobster to work on with way more meat-rewards.</p>\n\n<h2>All Out\nSouthern Dishes</h2>\n\n<p>The waitress from Sammy\u2019s also said we should try another restaurant to get the full experience of some famous southern dishes. So, we drove to another restaurant for a garlic shrimp poboy and boudin balls (pronounced boo-DAN.....the waitress laughed at us trying to pronounce it with our MN accent). Might as well hit it all in one night, right?</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_203712.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Taking the\norder to-go, we made our way to our sleeping space for the night in a Bass Pro\nShop parking lot. We ate the food in the\ncar (super messy!) and I tapped out. I\nwas so full. The spicy flavors from the\ncrawfish were finally starting to leave my lips and I was ready for bed. Chad kept going to town and finished\neverything. Woof. </p>\n\n<p>This po boy was good, but I liked the buffalo shrimp one at the other restaurant better. The boudin balls were so strange. It tasted like wild rice soup and felt like you were munching on a fried meatball. What a crazy little ball.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"is-resized\"><img src=\"/images/ferry-waves-southern-grub/20190411_204536.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"220\" /></figure>\n\n<p>Meanwhile throughout the second dinner, I was able to catch up with Mom and see how they are doing with the recent snowfall back in Minnesota. It sounds like they had a unique snow storm! </p>\n\n<p>While it was snowing, thunder boomed and lightning cracked. I have never heard of those types of storms before, but I guess it sometimes happens once in a blue moon. What a strange spring they are having. I\u2019ll send warm vibes up that way to help thaw y\u2019all out!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>That\u2019s a Wrap</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Super stuffed, all cleaned up from the multiple dinners and pillows dispersed, we hit the hay. The night was still hot and stuffy with humidity, but I think we are adjusting to it slowly. :) </p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 12: New Orleans, here we come!\u00a0 Last night, we slept in a Bass Pro parking lot in Baton Rouge after devouring a lot of southern dishes.\u00a0 My sleep was a little restless and I had crazy dreams.\u00a0 Chad has a streak of sleeping really well and had no complaints.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_071822.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>In the early morning hours, an older gentleman, who looked like he worked for Bass Pro, pulled into the parking lot and was shining a flash light onto the vegetation around the building. We think he was looking for people sleeping or camping on the grounds. He didn\u2019t bother us car-campers, so we went back to bed.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Morning Bridge Commute</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We packed up and hit the road early to make sure we were in New Orleans within the next couple of hours. We intended to hit the WWII museum when it opened at 10 a.m. Back when we were in Kansas City, a policeman had told us about the WWII museum (after we had mentioned we had just visited the WWI memorial) and that we should plan to spend the whole day there because there was so much stuff to read. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_082718-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_083922.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_084631.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The highway was rolling under our tires and we were on our way. Until morning traffic caught up to us. I guess the only way into New Orleans from Baton Rouge was a really long bridge? To the left the water went on without an end in sight, while on the right there was a train track mounded above the water with trees boarding the edge. No place to go but straight!</p>\n\n<p> We stayed on the bridge for hours. We tried to use the time to catch up with\nphone calls to family, but sometimes the signal would drop. It makes sense, there\u2019s a lot of water and\nnot a lot of service towers. I think\nthere might have been an accident with a gravel truck? We saw a police car and a large, freshly swept\narea of red dirt. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Parking in New Orleans</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We rolled off the bridge and headed downtown towards the museum to look for parking. Parking is extremely interesting! We searched the online forums and tried to understand the rules before we accidentally got towed, booted, ticketed, smash-and-grabbed, etc. The best situation we could put our car into was committing to an actual parking garage right next to the WWII museum. Safety first! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_101508.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_101535.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_101626.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad was really flustered from driving and dealing with trying to park while avoiding people coming up to our windows. To calm down, we skipped over to a corner caf\u00e9 that happened to have a lot of plants inside. </p>\n\n<p>Talk about grounding energy; we needed this space! I was able to pee in a lovely, elegant bathroom (I tried to refrain from telling Chad I had to go, it would have burst his stress level \ud83d\ude09) and we bought a large coffee to go. All better and more relaxed!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>WWII Exhibits</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The streets near the entrance to the building were crawling with kids just recently dropped off by school buses. We would be touring with the school and retired folks! It was Friday, so the clientele is a little different than a weekend.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_102134.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Large planes hung in the entry way, huge machinery lined the walls and a replica train with the old-school ticker-time-schedule greeted us when we walked through the front doors. Oh man, there was so much to see.</p>\n\n<p>We snagged a movie ticket, an interactive submarine exhibit ticket and headed out to look everything before our scheduled times at the events. There were interactive screens everywhere, informational videos around every corner, artifacts, posters, and audio recordings of people telling their stories about their part in the war. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_103456.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_103758-1.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_103812.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_103911.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The movie was inside a large auditorium, absolutely packed with tourists, and we watched a film overview narrated by Tom Hanks about the war sequence for 48 minutes. The seats vibrated and shook us as the trains pulled away from the stations full of soldiers and when airplanes were shooting at enemy planes with machine guns. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_121539.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Fake snow fell from the ceiling when winter war videos were on the screen and interactive elements came out of the stage floor throughout the film. I liked the movie and elements! Chad and I agreed that the movie didn\u2019t get into the details of the war, which was a bummer, but they probably expected us to walk through the exhibits to learn more.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_103859.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_104615.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_112339.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The interactive\nsubmarine was kinda a blow. Literally. Each person was assigned a position inside this\nmock-up submarine at an operating station to collaborate on a mission\ntogether. The mock-up was meh. The story moved on whether I pushed the\nbuttons or not (super not as interactive as I thought it was going to be). The submarine ended up having a misfiring\ntorpedo and it struck the side wall causing the ship to sink. This was a reenactment of events that\nactually took place and it was a neat idea. \nI think it would have been more fun for kids to experience.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_130441.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_131152.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_132237.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_134043.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Exhausted from walking, reading, listening, learning, and navigating the large facilities, we finally trekked out of the museum after 7+ hours. We highly recommend going to this museum and learning about the war events. Make sure you spend all day there!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_143239.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_143424-1.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_143912.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_151450.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_151815.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_163503.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2><strong>Waiting for Traffic</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We left the museum after 4 p.m. and noticed all of the streets were clogged with icky rush hour traffic. Instead of trying to deal with that, we called a to-go order from a restaurant for shrimp and grits for pick up. We walked a few blocks through the business district, grabbed the food and sat down to eat at a local park. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_170613.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_171533.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_171918.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_172531.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_173453.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The food was really rich and good tasting, but we were cheated so badly. $27 for two little bowls of food (which you then combined into one). Oh, we were not happy. Chad then hunted for the best fried chicken we could get our hands on and marched back to the parking garage with a set mission.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_173729.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2><strong>The World\u2019s Best Chicken</strong></h2>\n\n<p>According to our internet research, which is of the utmost reliability ;) , the Travel Channel, Food Network, and the James Beard Foundation claims Willie Mae's to have the best fried chicken in the World. It must be good! </p>\n\n<p>We ended up driving to a section of New Orleans that is still recovering from Hurricane Katrina. The restaurant was located on the corner and had a policeman standing outside keeping watch. As Chad and I were getting out of the car, a small truck pulled up next to us and a guy slyly walked out from a house to greet the driver. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_192508.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_182637.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_192113.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>I\u2019m guessing they were trading Pok\u00e9mon cards, but the plastic baggie looked pretty small. Maybe it was a micro SD card? Ya, he was probably buying a micro SD card from the guy. But, the trade was taking a little while. They seemed sheepish with us only 4 feet from them.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, the cop at the front door was really nice. He said where he watched us park was a good place to avoid a tow or ticket. He motioned for us to sit down outside on the benches and wait for a server to show us to our table. We didn\u2019t have to wait long and was shown to a table in the back of the establishment. All of the tables were filled and we were able to sneak in without a long wait. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/new-orleans-wwii-museum/20190412_185653.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Clientele was predominately tourists from out of state with a sprinkling of locals. We ordered two plates of fried chicken which came with our selected sides of green beans, red beans and rice. For sure needed to add corn bread sides, how could we not? The food was up in no time and we had a flinger lick\u2019n good time. We really liked the breading and the moist chicken. The green beans were a hit! Super flavorful and tasted nothing like green beans. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Home Sweet Home At Cracker Barrel </strong></h2>\n\n<p>We ducked out of town to a Cracker Barrel in Slidell for the night. Super tired from walking all day and worn out, we got ready for bed and hit the hay. It was a really good day at the museum and we highly recommend visiting the WWII museum to learn about the events and really take in how it all happened. </p>\n\n<p>If in town and wanting to get some good chicken, head over during the day for a bite to eat. Remember to hug a tree later or ground yourself in some other way because the energy of New Orleans can bring you all over the board. It rained that night so the car was washed clean and the air smelled like spring. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Day 13: Chad and I woke in a Cracker Barrel parking lot on the outskirts of New Orleans in a town called Slidell. The morning was humid and damp from the rain last night. Somehow after sleeping in many Cracker Barrels parking lots, we haven't gone into have food. Maybe we will have to do that sometime!</p>\n\n<p>Today we were focusing on hitting the French Quarter to visit Cafe Du Monde for coffee and to tackle an Italian sandwich. It's a famous Italian sandwich called the Muffalata and it's layered with different varieties of Italian meats and cheeses. It sounds good, but we weren't sure what size to get!</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_081301.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We were able to find parking at a lot right behind Cafe Du Monde; super lucky guess on my part, and we strolled the streets on the way to the cafe. When we were walking down some of the sidewalks, a large water truck was driving through spraying the streets with soapy water. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_081530.jpg\" /><p>Which is a good thing, because the streets and sidewalks were littered with remnants of last night's activities and smelled like an actual garbage dump. Mmmmm puke and alcohol! </p>\n\n<p>The streets were dead and there were only a few people walking around. So this is what the aftermath looks like?! I was really surprised and it totally blew my perception of New Orleans out the window. Every corner there were people walking around asking for food and money. There is truly a large economic displacement in this part of the coast.</p>\n\n<h2>Coffee Time</h2>\n\n<p>We stumbled into Cafe Du Monde and went inside to try the food. We had to use the restroom and the locations of the bathrooms were actually back inside the kitchen. So we got to see a little bit of the magic!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_081703.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_082106.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_082353.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>One order of beignets and two chicory coffees please. How were they you ask! They tasted just like a damn funnel cake from anywhere else :( . We could be wrong, but that's how we perceived it. So now we have to go find a funnel cake to compare notes. But, they were warm and fluffy.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_082857.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_082901.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_082903.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The coffee was too hot to even take any sips while we sat inside the cafe, so we took those to go. While waiting for the Italian grocery store to open for the sandwich, we continued walking up and down the main street. There were a lot of buildings that seemed happy and welcoming, while others were a little more run down and extremely ancient.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_082732.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>More Muffalatta </h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">By the time we looped back to the Italian grocery store, they were letting patrons in. There was already a line with at least five people in front of us waiting to get a sandwich. We could order a half sandwich, whole sandwich, or a supreme sandwich.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_090324.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_090334.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_090745.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_091129.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad and I spoke with the front counter assistant to help determine how hungry we were. We opted for a whole sandwich and stayed to eat it inside the shop. The supreme had added meat, making the sandwich absolutely massive. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_091715.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_091759.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_091829.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>After further investigation and rifling through the layers of food inside the bread, there were different slices of Italian meats, a specialty olive salad vinaigrette, and three different kinds of cheese, all hand-sliced meats and from real blocks of cheese.<br>We could have even gone with half a sandwich. There was so much food! </p>\n\n<p>It was so yummy and we are really glad that we were able to pop into the store. It was still an actual grocery store and the shelves are lined with a bunch of canned items. Super old posters lined the walls and you could tell that not a thing has changed since it opened almost 100 years ago.</p>\n\n<h2>Wandering the Quarter </h2>\n\n<p>Now with full tummies, Chad and I walked the entire French Quarter. We found a really old Catholic Cathedral and walked inside to find a orchestra practicing for an upcoming performance. The orchestra was also accompanied by a choir and we listen to opera singing mixed with classical music.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_085102.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_085921.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_094229.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_094846.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<figure class=\"is-resized\"><img src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_094929.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"400\" /></figure>\n\n<p>Chad handed me his coffee so he could snap a photo of a statue and I proceeded to look around the church in awe. When he wanted his coffee back, I had no idea which one was mine since I was so caught up with my surroundings. Chad laughed and knew this would happen and selected his from my hands. Silly Katie, so overwhelmed with music and pretty things.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we tried to go look at an old Cemetery but they wanted $20 per person to enter for a tour. I was pretty bummed because they looked really old, crumbly and unique but I wasn't willing to pay to have someone show me around. Maybe next time?</p>\n\n<p>Towards the end of our parking time limit, we walked into a Tea Store for me to use the restroom. They also happened to do palm and tea leaf readings. Chad and I didn't partake this time and watched as people came and went from their experience. We tried two different types of tea; a strawberry green tea and a hibiscus flower blend. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_095852.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_105116.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_110101.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>One of the guys who worked there took time to stop and tell us about his life growing up in the French Quarter. He said he lives and works in the quarter and doesn't have to drive hardly anywhere. They also have to play the parking meter game and don't have a set parking space because of all the events that take place in the streets. Even the locals get their car towed!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_121300.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_121350.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_124119.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_130901.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>People Everywhere</h2>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Chad and I hit the road in late afternoon and thank goodness we did! I guess they were having a festival the exact same time we decided to roll into town. The streets filled up with thousands of people, similar to the Minnesota State Fair, and the streets were packed to capacity everywhere you went.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_110553.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_110721.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_120057.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_111129.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_111439.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_112330.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_115311.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_115532.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Street performers, musicians and food vendors littered the middle of the streets. There were two guys completely painted and silver acting like tin men dancing to techno music. There was another guy who was dressed in a Transformer costume and would get on the ground, molding into a car and would actually drive around on remote control tires.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_130901-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_132511.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_133006.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Comparing Notes</h2>\n\n<p>We headed out of town back to Slidell and took the highway through Mississippi, Alabama, and ended in Florida. The drive doesn't take more than 4 hours and we were really surprised that we got as far as we did. We also stopped at Costco to pick up water and veggies to replenish our supplies.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_151445.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_161649.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_162439.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Crestview, Florida is where we spent the night and where we also compared fried chicken notes at Popeye's. The conclusion after having the same mock-up meal of fried chicken, green beans, red beans and rice was completely incomparable to the home cooked meal at Willie Mae's. We won't be hitting Popeye's again.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/new-orleans-food-music/20190413_142854.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Alabama is so green!</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Expecting storms later in the evening, Chad and I made camp at a Cracker Barrel parking lot and snuggled in. We had made intentions two roll down the windows as much as possible to allow for the cool breeze to blow in and we would wake up when the rain would start. Night night!<br></p>",

We sat in rocking chairs and\nwent into war-mode. We played viciously,\nstrategically planning out moves and chasing each other around the board. Eventually, I trapped Chad\u2019s last king and destroyed\nhim royally. We may have to have a\nrematch sometime at another Cracker Barrel down the road.</p>\n\n<h2>Spring Break at Panama City</h2>\n\n<p>Full and ready to hit the road, Chad drove us to Panama City while I worked at my desk.\u00a0 The landscape had the same feel as Louisiana with the watery bayous, but Florida has added tall pine trees and other filler bushes to accent the roads.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_132559.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_133349.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_134146.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_135442.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_135801.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We rolled into Panama City and I REALLY had to go.\u00a0 There were shopping centers decked out in pastel colors and the architecture changed to the beachy vibe of summer resorts. \u00a0I could either go in the JC Pennys or Starbucks.\u00a0 I chose Starbucks and we then continued to walk their main strip of little beachy shops.\u00a0 There were super touristy-based themes and stores, but I guess that makes sense since this place <a href=\"https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/panama-city-beach-identity-crisis-will-spring-break-make-a-return/970585141\">used to be one of major places to go for spring break</a>.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_171603.jpg\" /><p>We tootled down to the beach and looked at the waves.\u00a0 Since we were wearing tennis shoes, we didn\u2019t want to get sand in the soles (our poor car, too!) and chose not to walk on the beach.\u00a0 There will be other beaches, so it wasn\u2019t too heart breaking to not touch the water (ok, it was a little\u2026but, I have outfits for those activities and I wasn\u2019t appropriately dressed.)</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_171613_008.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Since the\ncity decided not to continue promoting spring break in their town and changed\nthe ordinances, they are targeting a family destination place. Chad and I then\nwent down a worm hole researching the best places to spring break at, the\npolice force needed during those times, the revenue, crime and drugs, etc\u2026.\nAnyway, Panama City was a nice, quiet town and the beach looked super relaxing.</p>\n\n<h2>Touring the Capital\nof Florida</h2>\n\n<p>Somehow, I ended up driving and I took us on a highway lined with super tall, skinny pine trees.\u00a0 The road was hilly it was not a boring drive.\u00a0 After about 3 hours or so, we made it into the capital of Florida.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_181813.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_182729.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Tallahassee\nwas the cutest place ever! It had the\nsimilar vibe of Fargo, North Dakota (calm, quiet, family-oriented,\nlittle-college-town-feel); mixed with the look of Savanna, Georgia (massive\nsouthern trees with hanging moss and greenery everywhere); and hilly like the\nresidential streets of San Francisco, California. It was a really awesome place to visit. </p>\n\n<p>We did the\ndrive by tour of \u201cwalk-it-with-your-eyes\u201d Chad style and I drove around their\ndowntown space exploring while Chad researched for a unique place to eat. I loved it. \nIf I could have the college experience all over again, I would have\nchosen a campus like the University of Florida. \nThe weather is constantly nice (no snow, 50 mph winds, frozen below zero\ndays\u2026), there is greenery everywhere with massive southern trees and\nflowers. The buildings were constructed\nwith red brick and it created a wonderful atmosphere. That was my ideal college campus. </p>\n\n<h2>More Southern\nFood Please</h2>\n\n<p>Chad remembered that we haven\u2019t tried gumbo yet and we had set out for <a href=\"http://www.cooshs.com/\">Coosh\u2019s Bayou Rouge Restaurant</a>.\u00a0 We ended up with gumbo, \u00c9touff\u00e9e, jambalaya, shrimp and grits, and a few hush puppies.\u00a0 OH. MY. \u00a0The favorite was the shrimp and grits (it wasn\u2019t as good as the one in New Orleans) and the gumbo had a unique flavor.\u00a0 I liked the \u00c9touff\u00e9e (creamy like a clam chowder soup) and the hush puppies were like little cornmeal circles quickly deep fried.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_191941.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_192152.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_192335.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/panama-city-beach-fl/20190414_192957.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Sleeping in\nthe Jungle</h2>\n\n<p>With the new\ntime zone, we jumped ahead an hour and it was already time for bed. We backtracked to the Cracker Barrel and\nclimbed the steep hills to the restaurant. \nThey have a mixture of parking lots based on the elevation of the hills. We made the loop scoping out the available\nspots and parked in one of the tiers next to other car campers and an RV. </p>\n\n<p>Now\ncompletely dark, the large happy trees with moss turned menacing-looking with\ncrooked branches. I snuggled into my\nsleeping bag and pillow palace, ignoring the crazy shapes of nature outside our\nwindows. There were stray cats prowling\non the hunt in the parking lots and on the grassy hills towards the restaurant. We counted at least four of them! </p>\n\n<p>There were no storms expected for the night and we were able to roll the windows down just a crack for air flow and let the cool night air seeped in. \u00a0But, not enough to let a potentially rabie-filled feline hop in for a nibble.\u00a0 It truly is the jungle!\u00a0 Little jungle cats are everywhere!</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 15: \u00a0The jungle loomed above the car and from my reclined sleeping position, I can see out of the windshield twinkling green leaves and the sun bursting through the branches.\u00a0 It was serene.\u00a0 That night was probably one of the best night\u2019s sleep I have had on the trip; at least in the top 5.\u00a0 We rested in a Cracker Barrel parking lot in Tallahassee, Florida with the intention to head down south towards Tampa. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/img_20190415_071020_682.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Chad was\nstill out cold, but I was wide awake. I\nsnuck my phone out and worked on editing blog items in the comfort of my pillow\npalace. The morning air was crisp and\nthe wind peaked inside the car occasionally to keep me company. Chad finally woke about 45 minutes later,\nalso extremely rejuvenated, and we started the morning in high spirits. </p>\n\n<h2>WiFi &\nFuel Please</h2>\n\n<p>We made the\nrounds to Starbucks for a faster internet connection and Chad worked on\ndestination map points. Once caught up\non previous adventures in New Orleans, we hit Costco for gas. Apparently, it was so windy yesterday coming\nacross Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama into Florida, we went from getting 40\nmpg to 33 mpg. Yikes! </p>\n\n<p>I totally succumbed to a carrot cake (side note:\u00a0 back home, I went on a carrot cake exploration to determine which local shops had the best carrot cake.\u00a0 I had not tried Costco\u2019s).\u00a0 This cake was super special because they had put apriocot filling between the layers of the cake and had dumped extra raisins into the batter.\u00a0 YUM.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190413_164811.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The frosting ratio of cream cheese to sugar was perfect and the apricot flavor was interesting.\u00a0 It got lost in the flavor of the cake and overload of frosting.\u00a0 But, my taste buds were bigger than my stomach\u2026.it was a huge cake!\u00a0 Chad doesn\u2019t prefer raisins and only took a few bites\u2026.that\u2019s way too much for me to eat alone!\u00a0 Hopefully, if we blast the car with AC, the cake will last a few days.</p>\n\n<h2>Rollin\u2019 to\nthe Warm Weather</h2>\n\n<p>Destination\nmapped to Tampa, we cruised for over 4 hours without stopping into any towns\nalong the way. We pulled out some\nbananas, a bag of baby carrots and a large cucumber for breakfast. Munch. Much. \nRefraining from chugging water, I finally reached a spilling-over point.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_120334.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cChad, just giving you a heads up that I will need to stop relatively soon.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><p>Changing the\nsubject, Chad responded with, \u201cdo these carrots taste funny at the bottom of\nthe bag? We will have to throw these\naway and then we can look for a place for you to go. But, carrots first!\u201d </p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\ud83d\ude09 Someday Chad, I will be driving and I will\npass by all of the travel stops to get you back. </p>\n\n<h2>Cuban\nSandwiches? Yes, Please!</h2>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_151907.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_152129.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_152538.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Tampa destination #1: Heights Public Market.\u00a0 Chad had read that there was a really good Cuban sandwich there to try at <a href=\"https://www.hemingwaystpa.com/\">Hemingway\u2019s</a>, so we ordered the Hemingway Cuban and the La Frita Cubana.\u00a0 The Cuban was really good; the Frita was so-so.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_144145.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Frita Right, Cuban Left</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>The environment of the market was super cool. The place was inside a large building that <a href=\"https://armatureworks.com/history/\">used to house Tampa\u2019s street cars</a> back in the day. The owners\u2019 transformed the space into an indoor/outdoor market, co-working space and a place to hold large events.\u00a0 I would for sure go back!</p>\n\n<h2>Update on Chad's Beard</h2>\n\n<p>It's been 15 days and Chad finally has some definition to his little beard spikes (left photo in collage below). His chin reminds me of little hedgehog quills ;) Soon, he will have his majestic millennial mullet back like before (we hope). </p>\n\n<p>(Side note: Chad has been participating as a model in the Twin Cities Wedding Fair about 3-4 times a year since 2014.)</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/chads-beard-progression.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>Ybor City\n(Pronounced E-bor)</h2>\n\n<p>After food,\nwe were really close to Ybor City and decided to pop in for a brief visit. On the way in to Tampa, I read out loud about\nthe history of the state of Florida and it came in handy. While walking around the main street, there\nwere historic plaques all over reiterating exactly what we had just learned\nabout. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_160023.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_160155.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_160350.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The best part about walking the main street was a really weird store we walked into where a lady was selling dead things (I found a dentist chair and tooth grinder!) and the wild chickens running around the city streets.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>Some of chickens were the breed called <a href=\"https://www.mypetchicken.com/chicken-breeds/Wyandotte-B6.aspx\">Golden Laced Wyandotte</a>!\u00a0 The only reason I knew this was because I raised this variety to show in 4-H when I was little.\u00a0 (Grand Champion Breeding Pen & Grand Champion Showmanship!!)\u00a0 Hard core throw back \ud83d\ude0a </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_155554.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_160804.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_161712.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_162905.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_173302.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_164516.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_191715.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Tea for Us</h2>\n\n<p>Hoping over the bridge into St. Petersburg, I found a little tea place that offers wifi.\u00a0 When we arrived, it was a really chill joint called Muddy Water Kava with people slumped on the bar and the comfy couches.\u00a0 They offer <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324015.php\">Kava</a> (wow, who knew by the name of the shop??) but we stuck to regular tea.\u00a0 The waitress asked for the tab name, and I said \u201cChad\u201d.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_191447.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<blockquote><p>The barista\nresponded, \u201cyou\u2019re name is Chad?\u201d </p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I responded\nsheepishly, \u201cno\u2026he\u2019s chad.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The barista \u201coh, that would have been cool if your name was Chad.\u00a0 Talk about a gender-bender.\u00a0 I mean it could have been a neutral name like Alex, Morgan, Jordan...my names Jordan\u2026and then there\u2019s Chad.\u201d\u00a0 </p></blockquote>\n\n<p>We all busted\nout laughing and she mentioned she was inspired. \u201cCatch me when I have kids,\nthey might be called a Chad.\u201d</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/tampas-chickens/20190415_191607.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I nailed\nout some blogging and we partook in a surprise birthday party. I know, crazy. Someone brought in balloons, a cake, lit\ncandles and handed out noise makers to the locals. We were almost about to walk out the door when\nthe birthday boy walked in. Happy\nbirthday to you??? \ud83d\ude09\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/f0LSuHzr\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Sick as a Dog</h2>\n\n<p>So, at the\nend of the day, my body was not really happy with the weird tea we had (it\nwasn\u2019t that good at all, which is weird because it\u2019s tea\u2026) and the Cuban sandwiches,\nso it called for a body wide evacuation. \nEverybody out the way you came in! \u2639 No dinner for me that night, all that I wanted\nto do was go to sleep. Let\u2019s eat better,\nKatie! </p>\n\n<p>Of course,\nright before bed, I got my appetite back and was craving grits (plain, no\nadditives). Oh well, there is always\ntomorrow. Chad has an iron stomach and\nits a bottomless pit, so he hasn\u2019t had any issues.</p>\n\n<p>Rest well, Crack Barrel in St. Pete\u2019s.\u00a0 We parked and were all situated for bed when the sound of jet engines fired up.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a jet, but a commercial airplane taxiing to the end of the runway, which happened to be literally on the other side of the tree line from where we are parked.\u00a0 It was so loud!!!\u00a0 The car and ground shook when the plane accelerated, then the world was quiet again.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p><strong>Rule #526:\u00a0 Don\u2019t sleep next to an airport runway.</strong></p>",

    "content": "<p>Day\u00a0 16:\u00a0 Chad is turning into a true tourist as he is not considering getting out of bed before 8 a.m.\u00a0 Back in Minnesota, we would wake at 5 a.m. and be at the gym by 5:30 a.m.\u00a0 Talk about changing your circadian rhythm! I laid awake in St. Pete\u2019s, FL Cracker Barrel parking lot listening to the commercial airplanes take off from behind a group of trees.\u00a0 I counted at least 6 plane take-offs before Chad peeked out from under his sleeping mask.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me?\u201d he said as I was curled up, wide awake and reading a travel blog written by some of our friends. </p></blockquote>\n\n<p>So, I was up a few hours before him...it\u2019s not a crime lol.\u00a0 My road trip inspiration came from our friends Monika and Glenn and their adventures when they went on <em>Tripzilla</em> back in 2001.\u00a0 I think every morning I will add reading their blog to my routine.\u00a0 Glenn is updating their old site and moving the content to a new site, so stay tuned for the big reveal whenever that may be!\u00a0 They have great stories \ud83d\ude0a </p>\n\n<p>Summarizing (super short version): having lived in Chicago their whole lives, they literally packed their things into storage, asked family and friends to watch over their pets and plants, and went on the road to experience new ways of life and look for a new home-space together.\u00a0 They happened to be touring around the U.S. for over 5 months (including a trip to Hawaii\ud83d\ude0a)!\u00a0 I loved hearing the stories from Monika and I couldn\u2019t wait to do something like that when I got older.\u00a0 Well, here I am!\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure how long this trip will last, but Chad and I have been having similar experiences like they did.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Morning Caf\u00e9</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Pleasantly\nawake, we tootled to a local caf\u00e9 which happened to specialize in gluten-free\nbakery items too. I set up shop and Chad\ncame back with a slice of bell pepper quiche and two cups of black coffee. Oh, the quiche went down so fast.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_094059.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_094445.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>Chad, nervous about not getting his share, took out the knife and proceeded to slice the piece down the middle.\u00a0 \u201cThe person who cuts it, gets to eat it!\u201d exclaimed Sir Chad, and he happily claimed his territory. Obviously, someone was hungry \ud83d\ude0a </p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Caught up on the blog, Chad started to launch ideas out of nowhere and rapidly talking.\u00a0 I think the caffeine hit\u2026hard.\u00a0 We made a cartoon out of myself sipping coffee and a collage of Chad\u2019s many stages of beards. Check out yesterday\u2019s post to <a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/2019/04/16/tampas-chickens/\">see Chad\u2019s previous majestic millennial beard</a>. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/blogging-photo.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>St. Pete\u2019s\nBeach</h2>\n\n<p>We made it to\na real, pretty beach! And where there\nare nice beaches, there are also showers. \nHello, cleanliness! At this\npoint, it has been 8 days since our last shower in Dallas, TX. We have been routinely using wet wipes multiple\ntimes a day to make sure we can comfortably sit in the car with each other without\nholding our noses.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_144302.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>But first, a run on the beach.\u00a0 It was midday (oops\u2026. like the hottest part of the day and notably terrible for getting sun burned easily) and I lathered up in 50 SPF sunscreen, shorts and a sports bra.\u00a0 Chad opted to skip SPF for now since his skin isn\u2019t as sensitive as mine and dawned running shorts. Time for barefoot running!</p>\n\n<p>We also downloaded\na metronome to beep a 180 beats per minute cadence for us to run to. (Chad researched running techniques while I\nblogged and wanted to try them out.) So,\nwe practiced running to the beat, pushing off our feet properly (or trying to\nat least) and went for at least 30 minutes. I guess 30 minutes was too much for our\nskin! </p>\n\n<p>I burned my\nshoulders and arms, while Chad completely toasted his back. Ugh. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Shower Time</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The shower\nwater was so refreshing and slightly warm. \nWe brought out the soap bar and went to town on our skin. We did not wash our hair with soap, but only\nscrubbed our scalps with the fresh water. \nWe have found that our individual hair oils do better if we don\u2019t rinse\nthem out with shampoo (avoid the poof and tame the curls!!).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_134942.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_140216.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_140226.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_144142.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We also\nrinsed out some of our Patagonia attire (Patagonia Princesses all the way) and\ndried it on the hot hood of the car. \nThey were all done in no time!</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Mission: West Coast Florida</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Our friend\nBob, who we are in route to visit, recommended a list of things to see while we\nmake our way down the west coast of Florida. We are ready to accept the\nmissions.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/bob-mission-florida-coast.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"386\" />\n\n<h2><strong>Did someone say Reuben?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>First stop on the list was to cross the Tampa Skyway Bridge from St. Pete\u2019s peninsula onto the main land.\u00a0 We then set the GPS to Caddy\u2019s at the Beach for dinner.\u00a0 OH HO HO!\u00a0 They had beach front property, volleyball nets and indoor/outdoor seating.\u00a0 Welcome to the vacation destination restaurant!\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_150824.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_1547280.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_155926.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_163519.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_163554.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We tried the\nGrouper Reuben Sandwich (say what!?) and it was really good. Who thought of putting a fish into a sauerkraut\nsandwich? The jalapeno poppers were poppin\u2019\ngood and the seafood chowder was yummy to chow down. \ud83d\ude09 Super burnt and super warm, we retreated to the car and set off to\nfind a rest spot for the night.</p>\n\n<h2>Pie</h2>\n\n<p>But first, PIE! :) Chad found a little Yoder's Amish Village restaurant that has over 30 homemade pie flavors available and a little restaurant (there was also a veggie stand).\u00a0 We ordered pie to go from their to-go window and ate outside on their pavilion.\u00a0 The pecan pie was REALLY something.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_175502.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_175835.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_180623.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_180925.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad\u2019s\ncomments (high on caffeinated truth serum *read fast to get full effect*) \u201cI\ncould actually taste the different flavors as to compared to when I worked at\nBaker\u2019s Square. When I had [their] pecan\npie it would only taste like one flavor. \nThis is quality homemade pecan pie! I wonder if John Meier makes a good\npecan pie?????? He makes everything\nyummy. Dana is sooo lucky.\u201d</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_181722.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I tried the black\nberry pie and really liked the bitter/sweet taste. The filling actually held together and didn\u2019t\nspill out onto the container. Now that\u2019s\na good filling.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Breezy Windows </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Now, the bugs are actually active at night and I had to defend our fortress from a little quarter-sized spider trying to crawl in last night.\u00a0 We actually had to take action now and figure out how to put bug screens up on the back seat windows.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_184838.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_184949.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_191820.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_192311.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>While Chad engineered the window coverings in a Home Depot parking lot, I typed away and caught up with my Dad about Easter plans.\u00a0 We won\u2019t be back in time for the big family bash, but I hope everyone has a great time!\u00a0 Drive safe you northern rellies, enjoy the cities \ud83d\ude0a\u00a0 </p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_200811.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Window A</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Window\nA: the bug screen is tucked into the weather\nsealing around the glass using a tool engineered from the handle of a gallon\nwater jug.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_200650.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Window B</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Window B:\u00a0 the bug screen is adhered to weather stripping around the entire window with duct tape.\u00a0 The duct tape is not visible from the exterior of the car.</p>\n\n<h2>No Cracker\nBarrel Near</h2>\n\n<p>Ugh, we were so bummed that there wasn\u2019t a happy Cracker Barrel close to where we wanted to stay.\u00a0 We had to settle for the parking lot between a fast food restaurant and Wal-Mart.\u00a0 There were trees lining the parking lot and dividing the parking rows, so it felt like you were still in a grove of trees.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We parked in the back facing the main road, which was next to a little grove of crunchy palm tree leaves and constant foot traffic walking behind us towards the restaurant.\u00a0 Ughhhh\u2026.. it wasn\u2019t going to be a great night for sleeping. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hello-st-pete-showers/20190416_220235.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Before bed, we bought some vitamin E lotion from Wal-Mart and lathered up!\u00a0 Uh man!\u00a0 The first day and we are toasted\u2026. Now the West Coast trip will be identified with the smell of cocoa butter. Here goes sleeping in the jungle!</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 17: The newly crafted window bug screens came in handy while sleeping next to a small palm tree grove at Walmart.\u00a0 In the morning, I looked out the window and saw little lizards skirmishing and running around with their newly won prey in their mouths.\u00a0 They could have climbed in the car with us! Oh, absolutely not!</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_094848.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The next adventure on our mission list from Bob was to hit Lido Beach, the Mote aquarium and the little shopping space. We made our way over there while I tended to my large blister on my foot from the beach run we went on. To make walking more tolerable, I sliced and squeezed, disinfected and bandaged the space. No flat tires for me today! Obviously, running properly is important.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_095431.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>See the little/big hump under the 2nd toe? Hello, blister!</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2>Mote Aquarium</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://mote.org/aquarium\">Mote Aquarium</a> was first on the list and we toured around learning about the reefs, local sea creatures, research Mote is doing to help preserve the reefs and species within it and we were able to watch a shark feeding.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_102349.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_102459.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_102833.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_120206.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>They fed the sharks in a conditioned manner by using targets on metal poles.\u00a0 The trainers rewarded them with food when they touched their noses to the target.\u00a0 I thought they were going to throw massive chunks of meat into the pool for a fish frenzy.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_105857.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We saw manatees (absolutely massive sea cows!), alligators, otters and large turtles in the mammal exhibit. \u00a0My favorite exhibits were between the manatees and the little baby jellyfish.\u00a0 \u00a0Chad\u2019s favorite part was that the admission fee actually goes to the research and operation costs of rescuing the sea life in the local areas.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_120007.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>It's not real...I don't want to wrestle a gator...</figcaption></figure>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of tourist traps!\" said Chad.</p></blockquote>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_120645.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>This is our favorite shot at the Aquarium.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2><strong>Lido Beach Caf\u00e9</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Now around 1 p.m., we walked the little shipping circle of Lido to look for a caf\u00e9.\u00a0 We received a text from a friend that morning asking if we were alive because there wasn\u2019t a blog post to read. \u00a0We settled in the <a href=\"https://www.greenzebracafe.com/\">Green Zebra Caf\u00e9</a> and proceeded to become caffeinatedly creative.</p>\n\n<p>Chad also caught up with his Uncle Steve and they chatted for a while until the line dropped.\u00a0 Happy squirrel-speed-talking Chad talked a mile a minute to me now that Steve wasn\u2019t there to transfer the energy to.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>Sighing heavily, Chad said \u201cit might be the coffee, Katie. But I really like Steve...\u201d </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/steve-collage-finished.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>And then it turned into Chad channeling his energy into hunting pictures for a collage to express his inner feelings. \ud83d\ude09 haha. Just leave me alone, Chad!</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/annoyed-katie.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Wow, he took a selfie...he never does that....!</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2>Lido Beach\nWalk</h2>\n\n<p>Drat, we wore\ntennis shoes. Oh well. We walked down to the beach entrance, looked\nin and walked back to the car. The beach\nlooked lovely and the water roared away with the crashing waves. It was mid-day,\nso my arms were feeling fried and I also didn\u2019t want to be out in the sun too\nlong anyway.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_153726.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_153741.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_153837.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_154054.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>All We Can\nEat</h2>\n\n<p>After\nspending the day using our coffee to push us through, we were more than ready\nto dive into all we could east sushi in Sarasota. We tried so many different types of dishes\nand sushi rolls! I liked this restaurant\nbecause they made the portion sizes smaller, which allowed us to try items we\nnormally wouldn\u2019t. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_162957.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_163538.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_164718.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_164843.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_172553.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_174217.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_174719.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>After dinner,\nwe walked to the car and my stomach gurgled. \nIt continued to gurgle, and we dashed to the nearest clean restroom at a\nCulver\u2019s. Alright, so no all-I-can-eat-sushi\nfor me the rest of the trip. Let\u2019s not\nhave a blowout. </p>\n\n<h2>Siesta Key Village</h2>\n\n<p>Chad and I parked\nin their downtown village and walked the main strip towards the beach. Chad derailed the course towards a little\nmini donut stand (I think these were the little guys he was talking about while\nhe researched the Amish pies) and we sampled their mini donut sundae and a\nlittle bag of cinnamon sugar minis. I\nguess Chad really likes mini donuts!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_190205.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_190833.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_190844.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_191143.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>I had a\ncouple, but stayed reserved because of the previous gurgling experience. Chad wrapped them up before we hit the end of\ndowntown strip. It was a cute, quiet\ntourism atmosphere with people everywhere. \nIt was not the least bit rowdy and it was controlled chaos with small\nchildren running around everywhere.</p>\n\n<h2>Siesta Key Beach</h2>\n\n<p>Voted \u201cTop 10\nBest Beaches in the United States\u201d, Siesta Key Beach is comprised of fine\nwhite-quartz crystal and has a beautifully serene atmosphere. There\nare even drumming circles held on the beach! Bummer we didn\u2019t run into any. We finally were able to walk on the beach without\nthe fear of getting burned! It was so\nfine, the sand melted between our toes. \nThe sun was setting and we loved everything about the space!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_191920.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_192121.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_192508.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_192737.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>My calves were\nextremely tight and sore from the beach run the other day, so walking was a\nlittle rough without shoes. My blister\nwas a little annoying, but I was more concerned about the arch tendons locking\nup while we walked. This is what happens\nwhen I\u2019ve been in a car too long and one little physical activity pushes my\nunprepared muscles passed their limit lol. \nMore activities, please! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_195100_003.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_195100_006.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_195100_009.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_195100_013.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_195100_020.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>After walking\nfor a bit, Chad\u2019s stomach also started to gurgle. Uh oh\u2026.we are no where near public restroom\nand all you can see is sand dunes covered with people everywhere. There was no where to \u2018go\u2019. Walking a little more briskly, we made our\nway towards the other end of the beach where Chad said he could make out a life\nguard\u2019s tower. If a lifeguard had to sit\nthere all day, there would have to be a place for them to go. Perfect.</p>\n\n<p>We tried to\ntrek faster, but the dry sand was piled and my calves were protesting. Do you know Charlie Horse? He rode the beach with me all the way to the\nlife guard tower. Vengeance round two: gurgles\nstarted coming from my stomach too.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Chad, face disgruntled, looked alarmed and said, \u201cthose aren\u2019t bathrooms, those are just shelters\u2026this isn\u2019t good.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/4dfr1RCX\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>We started to scuttle shuttle our feet faster towards the many people resting on the beach watching the sun disappear.\u00a0 I thought I was walking in front of someone\u2019s photo of the sunset, and I moved out of the way.\u00a0 A thick Irish accent came from the dad saying I wasn\u2019t in the way and that the family was looking at pictures instead.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_192519.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_193134.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_193146.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Friends. I can make friends to solve our dilemma. \u201cExcuse me, have you been here long? Do you know where there are restrooms?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Irish\ngentleman, straight off the plane from Ireland, spoke in such a thick accent\nthat Chad and I stopped to listen to him, transfixed. It\u2019s a beautiful dialect. Anyway,\nwe finished scuttle-shuffling to the public restrooms FINALLY and were then\nstopped by a hippie requesting signatures for legalizing weed in Florida.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_195424.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<blockquote><p>Chad, about to burst his seams, grimaced a smile, stated \u201csorry, restrooms!\u201d and we bolted.</p></blockquote>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_201548.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_202117.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/sea-life-beach-towns-sunsets/20190417_201508.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Awkward Sleep</h2>\n\n<p>Recovered\nfrom our extremely romantic walk on the beach during the sunset, we made our\nway back to the car. I chatted with Mom while\nwe walked to hear about the crazy weather Minnesota is having and to chat about\nher experiences in Sarasota when she came to visit her grandparents. Chad and I ended up having laugh attacks and\nit was a jolly good time.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the\ntricky part is finding a space to rest. \nThere are not any Cracker Barrels nearby, but there was a Costco. We have camped there before on this trip and gave\nthat one a try. It was wicked hot, the\nbug screens were deployed with the back windows completely down and the air was\nstill. Woof, it was hard to fall asleep.</p>\n\n<h2>BUSTED.</h2>\n\n<p>I guess this Costco is attached to a mall-like setup and at about 1 a.m. a security guard came up to the driver\u2019s window shining a flash light.\u00a0 He kindly asked us to leave the parking lot since it\u2019s privately owned and pointed out where we could go.\u00a0 At least he was nice about it.\u00a0 I mean when you\u2019re job is to drive around a mall all night long, we provided some actionable item for him to jazz up his night!\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>But, we were super drowsy and only had 15 miles left in the tank to tootle around for a new sleeping space.\u00a0 (In the morning, we would have filled up with gas at Costco!) The local gas station a few miles away was also closed.\u00a0 We painstakingly limped down a street and hunted for a new location.</p>\n\n<h2>Relocation to\nLowe\u2019s </h2>\n\n<p>After trying the local grocery store and Target (they were also apart of a mall so security would still be an issue), we ended up at Lowe\u2019s.\u00a0 Now wide awake, kinda crabby, hot, and extremely tired, we re-situated for rest. It\u2019s 2 a.m. Ick.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>On the\npositive, we were able to find a spot and still have enough gas to get us to\nthe station in the morning. We snagged a\nnew sleeping space and the mosquitos humming outside the screened window couldn\u2019t\nattack us. Let\u2019s try sleeping again, shall we?</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 18: After spending the evening jockeying the car around to different sleeping spaces, we work at Lowe\u2019s to a full parking lot, maintenance trimming hedges and loud birds. Oh, what an restless evening. Hopefully, we don\u2019t have another like it! Thankfully, we were able to sleep in this morning to make up for lost time.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Coffee at Starbucks</strong></h2>\n\n<p>So, a slightly crabby Chad and a tired kitty walked into a coffee shop\u2026 and they got jacked on medium and dark roast quoffees.\u00a0 Thank you, Starbucks.\u00a0 I filled in the blanks from yesterday\u2019s plunders and Chad worked on things.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t sure what he was up to, I was ultra-focused to make sure I got everything taken care of so the rest of the day could begin as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_113745.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I sat at my\nown table, juice cords hooked into the floor to my left, and even more left\nChad sat at his own table. Ah,\nfinally. A little distance! But, still close enough to talk comfortably\nand poke if necessary. </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cHey, at least it\u2019s not the 5-foot rule\u201d \u2026.Chad scratches his face and looks sheepish\u2026 \u201coh, you would like that wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d </p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><p>Chad widened his eyes and shook his head yes, \u201cMMHMMMM, a lot!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_111620.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_111658.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Big Cat\nHabitat</h2>\n\n<p>The first\nstop of the day was the Big Cat Habitat. \nTo prevent me from getting burned further, I wore a thin, breathable long\nsleeve hoodie and Chad covered up with his long sleeve under armor quarter\nzip. It was noon, over 80 degrees and\nthe hottest day we have experienced yet. \nMeoow, that\u2019s hot.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_132523.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_133237.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_133741.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_134158.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_133832.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We ended up\nhaving perfect timing to watch an indoor tropical bird/parat performance. The trainer led four birds through little\nexercises, the most notable was the Olympic rings completed by a large rainbow-colored\nparakeet. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_140817_006.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_142239.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_144717.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_144853.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>In an hour,\nthere would be a big cat show. To kill\nsome time, we walked around the outside exhibits. They have a variety of bears, cougars, lions,\ntigers, ligers (only found in captivity), exotic birds, a variety of monkeys,\nand a petting zoo consisting of pygmy goats, emus and llamas. If you wanted, you could feed any of the\nanimals with the help of a volunteer and a metal pole to reach through two\nlayers of fencing. One layer to keep\nhumans out and one layer to keep the occupants in. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_144940.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The big cat\nshow was our favorite. The MC for the\nshow was on the Big Cat Board for the park, the son of the family who made the\npark possible and has been handling/working with big cats his whole life. He was also a hoot. He mixed facts about the lives of the cats in\nwith his jokes to make for an entertaining show. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_145015.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The biggest\ntake away from his show was to do your research on the different animal\nactivist groups before donating your time and money. He never named names or shared his opinion on\nwhere the funding should go, but urged the audience to make educated choices about\nwho they are supporting. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_145414.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_150759.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_152353.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_153447.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_153456.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The Big Cat\nHabitat hosts over 50-80 big cats, and each one can consume easily 50 lbs of\nmeat a day. That\u2019s wicked\nexpensive! Big zoos may only have a few\ncats because of the costs associated with feeding them. Local grocery stores in the area of Sarasota\nhave partnered with the Habitat to serve the animals the remaining unsold food\nand donors to the Habitat also help keep food in the animals bellies. </p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_144952.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Snuggles :)</figcaption></figure>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThey get a lot of organic foods!

The tour, about 50\nminutes long, scooted us out on a covered pontoon into a very shallow lake and\nthe guide shared about the spotted wildlife. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_162930.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_163006.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_163342.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_170106.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_171446.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We saw\nalligators (large and small), a few guys fishing for tilapia with nets, wild\nboars, birds, and turtles. The driver/tour\nguide was funny and shared a lot of facts about Florida, the animals and\nvegetation. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_173002.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_174233.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_174251.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_170246.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_171324.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The park was\nfilled with a mixture of Live Oak (they lose their leaves but grow them back to\nstay green all year long) and Palm Trees. \nThe Spanish Moss hanging from the oaks swung over the road while we\nweaved to the </p>\n\n<h2>Tree Canopy</h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_182856.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>On the way\nout of the park, there was a little trail that led to a research suspension\nbridge within the jungle. We walked\nthrough a dried marsh/bayou (during their wet season, the trail isn\u2019t\naccessible since it would be underwater by at least 3 feet of rain water) and\nexplored the bridge. Aftter the bridge,\nwe climbed the look-out tower to view the park high above the trees.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_181100.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_182416.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_182818.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_182909.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Oddly enough,\nthere were a TON of horse flies at the very top and they swarmed our faces.

Oops. Literally as I\u2019m showering the \u201ccamp host\u201d!?\n(whatever that is) walks in to ask what I\u2019m doing\u2026..uhg\u2026.well, I\u2019m clean\nsoooo\u2026..oh well, chad drive!...Quickly! </p>\n\n<p>Bonnie and\nClyde here, trying to steal showers! Lol I was thoroughly embarrassed, I guess\neven as an almost grown up I don\u2019t like being scolded or in trouble\u2026. I say I\u2019m\na grown up, but chad begs to differ\u2026 lol </p>\n\n<h2>Italian\nDinner for Two</h2>\n\n<p>After our\ngreat escape from the Park Law, we raced towards Venice. We plugged into the GPS Sharkey\u2019s at the\nPoint for food near the beach, but there was over a 90 minute wait. The sun was about to set, and it was pushing\n8 p.m. We asked the hostesses for other\nfood recommendations and headed to their historic downtown quickly before the\nrestaurants closed at 9 p.m. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_201719.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We were\nseated at an Italian outdoor pavilion and was given bread to eat with an\namazing spicy spread. We were about to\nfinish the loaf and hadn\u2019t received menus yet. \nHmm? Maybe we had to finish the\nwhole thing before we can be served? We\nate the rest. Still no menus.</p>\n\n<p>A waiter came\nout looking confused and asked us if we were there for dinner. I guess the lady who seated us forgot to\nmention we were out on the pavilion and we were skipped! The restaurant only takes cash or checks too\nand we only had $14 to work with. Chad\nmade a dash to an ATM down the way while the waiter put in a rush on an\neggplant lasagna. At this time, the\nkitchen was already closed, but they put the order in anyway.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_202311.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/myakka-state-park-cats/20190418_210205.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>By the time\nChad came back with currency, the food was almost done, and the waiter brought\nanother loaf of bread. The food was out\nin no time and we devoured the super cheesy spread with a side of angel hair\npasta in marinara. So rich, so cheesy,\nsuper tomato-ie, and left us full. We\neven took some to go. Fare well, Venice!\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/4MzmzBkp\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Home: Cracker\nBarrel</h2>\n\n<p>Finally,\ncivilization. There were only three cars\nparked in the lot for sleeping (all in the best spots ofcourse) and we made\ncamp. There was no wind, it was hot and\nthere were potentially thunder storms coming in the morning; we were in for a\nlong night.</p>\n\n<p>I woke near 1\na.m. and urged Chad awake to drive to a gas station. Our stomachs were apparently done digesting\nthe rich, cheesy dinner. After 19 days\nof being a tourist, I\u2019m really going to need to tame my food choses and get on\na better schedule. </p>\n\n<p>We returned\nto camp and one of the cars had left the darkest part of the lot. We snagged their spot and went back to\nbed. I woke to hear a crunching in the\npalms next to my side of the car. Out\nfrom the brush snuck an ugly looking possum with the whitest face and\ntail. A minute later, I heard a small\ndeath squeal\u2026I think it found dinner. \nAbout 30 minutes later, there was a horrific, blood curdling animal\nscreams from the woods behind us??? Yikes! </p>",

Sad to say, <a href=\"https://billypenn.com/2015/07/25/why-its-called-philadelphia-cream-cheese-even-though-its-not-from-here-fertile-land-and-clever-marketing/\">Philadelphia cream cheese didn't originate in Philly</a>, but was named after the city where the high quality milk came from at the time. Disappointed Katie wasn\u2019t going to get a bagel here. I can wait until New York for the best bagels!</p>\n\n<h2>Morning Routine</h2>\n\n<p>Chad and I woke in the back row of a travel center for truckers next to transit vans that also had car campers spending the night (about an hour out of Philly near Wilmington). We cleaned, I set up the desk to get the blog written and Chad routed us to Philly.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/independence/20190501_123232.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Independence Hall</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>I researched the \u2018best\u2019 place to find a Philly cheese steak sandwich and tried to find an old Italian bakery. That search than lead to discovering an Italian Market section near Center City. :) </p>\n\n<h2>Strolling Through Old Brick</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Parking:\nAutopark at Independence Hall ($21 for whole day)</strong></p>\n\n<p>We skipped the cracked Liberty Bell and saw the hanging one inside Independence Hall while while it struck the hour. The bell tower rang into the courtyard while chiming with churches\u2019 bells. It was a really beautiful moment. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Exploration: </strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>Independence Hall \u2013 hall where the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were debated and signed </li><li> Second Bank of the United States \u2013 a portrait artist lived here and painted notable leaders of the time </li></ul>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_123202.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_123344.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_123629.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_123926.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<ul><li>Carpenter\u2019s Historic Hall \u2013 held the First Continental Congress in 1774 and other historic meetings</li></ul>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_124623.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_124044.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_124142.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_124239.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_124401.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_124542.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<ul><li>Ben Franklin Museum \u2013 we walked around the facility (no tour/fee if you want) of the area where Ben Franklin lived and worked</li></ul>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_125111.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_125156.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_125323.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_125333.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_125401.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_125518.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_125530.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_1255570.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_125738.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_130253.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_130303.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad remembered there was a Ben Franklin home to investigate and\nwe were able to walk into his home space, see a printing press demonstration,\nlook at the old home construction and learn a little about his life. The ink beaters looked like massive punching\ngloves on sticks and would cause a large \u2018blotchy\u2019 mark on your cheek, if hit. \ud83d\ude09 </p>\n\n<p><strong>First stop: <a href=\"https://www.sarconesbakery.com/\">Sarcone\u2019s Bakery</a> before they closed at 3 p.m.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The walk there was a mix of downtown buzz, residential old red\nbrick apartment homes and then transitioned to kinda sketchy yards, abandoned\nbuildings and smashed retail together in the oldest brick buildings I have ever\nseen. We walked fast towards the Italian\nmarket lol. It was really empty, since\nmost people are at work during the day, but the skinny roads were packed with\ncars trying to work through it all.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_134022.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_134418.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_134515.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Sarcone\u2019s Bakery: Super old, super good. Granted, we only tried their LAST cannoli pastry stuffed with ricotta chocolate chip filling. The lady behind the counter was blunt, didn\u2019t have much of an outgoing personality and actually filled the cannoli right there on the spot. It was reallyyyyyyy good. I would go back. But, forget about the Minnesota nice attitude because it doesn\u2019t really get you any inside knowledge/secrets here, let alone a 'helloe'.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_133612.jpg\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_132905-3.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_133410-4.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_133617-1.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p><strong>Second Stop: Pat\u2019s\nPhilly Cheese Steak Sandwich</strong></p>\n\n<p>Apparently, the first Philly cheese steak sandwich was made (invented and originated) at <a href=\"https://www.patskingofsteaks.com/\">Pat\u2019s King of Steaks</a>. Family owned and operated since 1930, they compete against across the street rebel <a href=\"https://www.genosteaks.com/\">Geno\u2019s Steaks</a> (1966). Use your best judgement and try a sandwich from any local restaurant. We were told by a community assistant (like community trust officers, but not officers) to avoid the food stand versions because they aren\u2019t as awesome. \u201cYou can\u2019t really go wrong,\u201d according to the lady we spoke to. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_134702-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_134958.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_135121.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_135617.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_135730.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>At the end of the strip of stores, resided Pat\u2019s on the corner\n(literally, the corner lot. Special\nAssessments must be real expensive with 3 streets boarding the property!). We ordered the cheese Philly, \u2018wit onions\u2019\nand \u2018wit out\u2019 cheese wiz (sub for provolone instead). The order was up in less than 30 seconds and\nwe sat outside to eat it. It was just\nlike a regular sandwich and didn\u2019t blow either of our minds. Aw man\u2026.they got us good. Kinda a bust.</p>\n\n<p>We were going to try the competing Geno\u2019s, but decided that we\ncould find another yummy. We can make\nthese at home no problem.</p>\n\n<h2>Recovery Drink & Local Talk</h2>\n\n<p>Walking back towards the car, I saw the largest mocha coffee pot\nEVER! To the point where I thought it\nwould be a great idea to go inside and ask the \u2018nicer\u2019 looking coffee barista\nwhere the best food is located. We\nordered a coffee and the guy behind the counter shared that there isn\u2019t really\nany good food in Philly, except for the Mexican food. Lol. What??</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_135924.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_140524.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_141914.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>He said there is a restaurant only open 3 days a week and has the BEST homemade corn tortillas with their 3-day slow roasted meat, all made into mouth-watering tacos in the owner\u2019s personally-made clay oven. I guess we will have to come back to the Italy Section to have great Mexican food?!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_143410.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_143421.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Taking our coffee on a stroll, we dodged across a street that had a car about to run the stop sign. I had to hop/bound the remaining way to clear the vehicle. I made it! But, happened to spill some coffee on my tennis shoe during the process.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_145057.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_1452210.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_145908.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_150009.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>Chad, oh clever Chad, mentioned, \u201cdon\u2019t worry about that stain on your shoe, Katie. You only have to worry about keeping me happy!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><p>\ud83d\ude0a To that, I responded, \u201cannnnnd to write down what we do each day so you don't forget it! Your happiness and the blog are very important.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<h2>Walk Around the City Center</h2>\n\n<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent walking around the new and old buildings, checking out City Hall, seeing a Masonic Temple, and investigating the entrance to a subway system.\u00a0 I have never seen one in person and I wanted to check it out.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_144706.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_150611.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_150737.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_150905.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cKatie, don\u2019t your feet hurt? \u2026 Yeah, we should start heading back to the car\u2026.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"/images/independence/20190501_150503.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Not a fat chance! We walked\ndown the steps into the subway entrance and back through and up to the other\nside from where we came from. I should\nhave guessed that I would have to purchase a ticket before I could see the\ntrains\u2026. Maybe in New York I can see a subway!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_153103.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_1531320.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Oh! I also was able to try\na Philly-style pretzel that is box shaped for $.85 from the Pretzel Factory!</p>\n\n<h2>National Constitution Center</h2>\n\n<p>The last item for the day in Philly was to buzz through the National Constitution Center because Chad remembered seeing kidney stones on display when he was there last time. Without having to go through the ticketed part of the museum, we ducked into a little section of artifacts. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_160748.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_163022.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_163028.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_163536.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>No more than a minute inside this little room, a man approached us\nand I thought he was going to kick us out for not having a ticket for this\nexhibit. In fact, he wanted to share\nwith us about a new exhibit they are opening up on May 9 to explain the different\nAmendments for the United States. Sadly,\nwe were only planning on being in Philly for the day and he found this\ndisheartening. So, he offered to take us\non a private behind-the-scenes tour of the exhibit while it was still being\nworked on!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_163840.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_164142.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>But first, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr%E2%80%93Hamilton_duel\">duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr</a>.\u00a0 The gentleman, Sheldon Gilbert, explained in detail the famous duel and how crazy of a time it was back then to have major dueling laws changed as well as how to properly review court cases with the new proceedings. </p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190501_160748/\"><img src=\"/images/independence/20190501_160748.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p> Sheldon then lapsed into discussion on artifacts of quill pens, notes, paper, stop watches, and personal notes that have been preserved to this day.\u00a0 His passion for history is absolutely contagious.\u00a0 Chad and I hung on his every word and asked questions often.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190501_170623/\"><img src=\"/images/independence/20190501_170623.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p>He then took us into the secret exhibit and there we saw the crew still working on the finishing touches of the permanent display.\u00a0 They were even still placing artifacts into their cases and finalizing the graphics on the walls! (an old ink quill and pot used by former slave <a href=\"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/02/i-am-your-fellow-man-but-not-your-slave.html\">Frederick Douglass used to write a letter his previous master</a> rolled by us on a cart and was installed into its exhibit right in front of us.)</p>\n\n<p>We talked about the history of the amendments, especially the 14<sup>th</sup>,\nto describe how without the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment, none of the previous\namendments really had any power. He then\nexplained that he spent 10 years as a lawyer studying legislative work and had\npracticed in Minnesota and Chicago. Now currently working with his favorite law\nprofessor, who happens to run the National Constitution Center, he is basically\n#2 and helps facilitate the exhibits and events. He loveds the \u2018nerdy\u2019 details of history and\nsharing it with others.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_170605.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_171401.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We spent over an hour and half with him going over the history of\nthe exhibit and eventually parted ways. \nThank you so much for your history lesson, the special guided tour and\nyour tie! Wow. We live in a country with so much new, rich\nhistory. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_1715430.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_171804.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_181636.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Car packed and ready, we hit the road out to New Jersey! </p>\n\n<h2>Chester, New Jersey</h2>\n\n<p>In the middle of New Jersey somewhere, we pulled off into a little town called Chester because of the old houses-turned-restaurants.\u00a0 The fog was coming in and it seemed like the right mood for ice cream. \ud83d\ude0a But first, an Italian shop.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/independence/20190501_200047.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We tried their Eggplant Supreme (mozzarella cheese, basil, balsamic vinegar on toasted bread) and their Mouth of Fire (spicy capicola, spicy sopressata, hot peppers, lettuce, tomato, oil and vinegar on regular bread).\u00a0 The eggplant sandwich was REALLY yummy! The hot sandwich could have had more spice, and that's coming from me, a tame northern-spice-tolerance lady. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_201147.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_2020010.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_202102.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_203214.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Down the street was the ice cream parlor and we tried their banana\nsplit with their homemade ice cream. \nThree flavors included pistachio, Oreo mint and caramel vanilla with\nsprinkled oreos and hot caramel on top. \nAlso, quite delicious.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_203627.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_203944.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_203950.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/independence/20190501_205207.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>I ended the night with a stomach ache\u2026..(I should have known\nbetter, I always get sick with sugar\u2026.) and Chad said he feels better when he\nhas a salad. He can handle these foods\nbetter than I can. </p>\n\n<h2>Home Sweet Cracker Barrel</h2>\n\n<p>Only an hour out of Manhattan, New York, we situated ourselves\npretty good to make it into the city in the morning to then start our\nadventures in the Big Apple. Chad recommended\nknocking out the blog for today to make sure we have enough time for adventures\nin New York tomorrow. What a late\nnight! It\u2019s slightly raining out, Chad\u2019s\nfeet STINK from his hiking boots and has taken precautions to relieve the car\nof the stench (isopropyl alcohol spray/drenched boots now residing in the\ntrunk). Rest well! Stink less! </p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 19: Today was the day we would catch up with our\nfriend Bob! He has been patiently\nwaiting for us to make our way down the coast of Florida to see him in Bonita\nSprings. We haven\u2019t seen each other for\na few years since he said \u2018see ya\u2019 to MN and it happens to be a perfect time for\nus to catch up!</p>\n\n<h2>Fort Meyers\u2019\nConstruction</h2>\n\n<p>We woke in\nVenice, FL at Cracker Barrel and started out on the road right away. The plan was to stop at Fort Meyer\u2019s Beach,\nwalk around, and then head south to find a coffee place. </p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_074647.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Morning view from Cracker Barrel</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>When we pulled into the downtown beach access locations, it was under construction and there were cars everywhere. I guess Good Friday may have allowed more people to be out and about, but this was crazy. It was only 9 a.m. and traffic was terrible in the small, cramped \u2018beach town\u2019 space. </p>\n\n<p>We finally found a parking lot, parked and discussed if it was even worth visiting right now (we were a little flustered and the current vibe of the space wasn\u2019t jiving with the peacefulness we just experienced in Siesta Keys).</p>\n\n<p>A voice like Rocky Balboa leaned down into\nChad\u2019s driver window to let us know the spot was $10. With arms comfortably resting on the window\nframe and head eye level with us, he exclaimed in typical Rocky Balboa speech\nthat he really liked the car desk. \nThanks! And, we won\u2019t be\nstaying\u2026. Sorry, not this trip!</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_142137.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Ugh...first time on the trip I have been caught....</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2>Hello Coffee Shop</h2>\n\n<p>We left Fort\nMyers behind, traveled the coast across a few large bridges and rolled into\nBonita Springs. So much better! The atmosphere was a lot more calming, the\npace seemed slower and I found a little coffee shop to help destress us both.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_105812.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_105911.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_110056.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Once parked, we\ncleaned the car, packed away our stray items, straightened ourselves and set\nthe intension to have a restful morning after the hype of Fort Myers. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_141704.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I randomly selected a local coffee shop named <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HelloCoffeeFL/\">Hello Coffee</a> off the map and it turned out to be the hang out for our local friends. I set up for the blog while Chad ordered some yummies. There were a few locals inside; two were intently playing a game of Chess. We ended up trying their breakfast burrito (large and fresh) as well as the spinach-feta quiche (the crust was on-point and the flavors were so rich). Both good! But, the quiche was the winner and it was scarfed down quickly. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/katie.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>While I blogged away, Chad reviewed a few articles as rain started to pour outside.\u00a0 Time flew by and before I knew it, our friend Bob arrived (flash rain now over)!\u00a0 We chatted for a bit catching up and then his lady friend Bridget came for a visit too.\u00a0 Brigid also brought along her tall drink of water Golden Poodle Adian, who stole everyone\u2019s hearts.\u00a0 The duo had to return back to the office and we bid them farewell.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<h2>Exotic Cars</h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_143021.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Bob, Chad and\nI toured through a dealership of exotic cars. \nI don\u2019t keep up with the varieties, but Chad and Bob investigated the different\nmodels thoroughly (that\u2019s what she said). \nBut, they did have a Back to the Future car\u2026. a DeLorean\u2026. Which was\npretty cool!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_1429200.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_143504.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_143515.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_143525.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_143553.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_143645.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_143812.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_143746.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Lovely artwork :)</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2>Hi Ho, Hi Ho,\nOff to Showers We Go</h2>\n\n<p>Bob and\nBridgett were super wonderful and let Chad and I take a pit stop in\ncivilization to clean up. We did some\nlaundry, took showers and chatted with Bob for most of the afternoon. It was great to catch up, relax with good\nconversation and expand our minds. Right\nas we were able to pack up for dinner, the rains came pouring down in sheets\nand if we stepped outside we would have instantly been soaked.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_171744.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>It's pouring! Hall is all clean now :)</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2>Fajitas,\nPlease</h2>\n\n<p>We made it to\nthe restaurant without taking another shower! \nIt\u2019s apparently common for rain and thunder to happen every day, then\nturn into bright blue skies. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_175556.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>For dinner,\nthe three of us dived into some Mexican yummies. Bob and I had the quesadilla and Chad ordered\nthe steak fajita with bell peppers. Now\nhaving been in the heat and humidity, the restaurant AC was WAY too cold.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_175618.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_185735.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The meal ended\nand it was time to say farewell to our friend. Bob also wrote up another whole list of things\nto see while we head down towards the Keys. \nThanks so much for your time and suggestions! It was really great seeing you again \ud83d\ude0a</p>\n\n<h2>Thunder Storms in the Everglades </h2>\n\n<p>Chad and I made our way out of town and onto highway 42 which\nwould take us through the Everglades. 7\np.m., the sun was going down and the nature scenes looked like something out of\nJumanji or Jurassic Park. As the sun\nset, the rain resumed its pelting. The sky\ncontinued to light up with massive cracks of lightning and we enjoyed the show.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hello-coffee-hi-bonita-springs/20190419_195915.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<blockquote><p>Driver Chad reported, \u201cnot sure if I ran over a snake or a tree branch\u2026but whatever it was, it\u2019s dead now.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The rain really started coming down towards the end of the park\nand the lightning lit the sky constantly. \nWhen we pulled into the next largest town, the rain pounded even\nharder. Thank goodness for RainX! We skipped through town, dodged branches in\nthe streets and cleared our way towards Cracker Barrel located in the very\nsouth part of Miami.</p>\n\n<p>After an eventful day of cleaning and everything water related, we\nfinally felt fresh and rejuvenated. Night\nnight!</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 20: Fist bump, we have survived over 20 days road tripping and 17 days sleeping in the car!\u00a0 The only disagreements we have had (that I can even maybe remember, everything is blurring together) is related to the best places to eat in each location, which parking spot real-estate would be most ideal at night and pulling over for me to use the restroom.\u00a0 Otherwise, we are two peas in a car. \ud83d\ude04</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190415_173245.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Chad is a great travel partner and I wouldn\u2019t trade him in. We would potentially trade in the car for a transit\nvan to travel in. It would be so much\nnicer to blend in. Maybe next time!</p>\n\n<h2>Cracker Barrel 1 a.m. </h2>\n\n<p>Chad woke me suddenly and asked for me to open my door. He had his hands cupped together and my sleep-clouded\nmind was hardly processing anything he was saying. After removing the item from the car, I\ngawked at him as he said he woke to a small frog landing on his hand, which he\nhad resting on his chest. YUCK!</p>\n\n<p>How did it get in the car? \nWe had all the windows shut for once because it was heavily down pouring\noutside. But, the little frog snuck in\nsomehow\u2026super disturbing. We both hit the hay again and hoped it wouldn\u2019t\nhappen again.</p>\n\n<h2>Day Trip to the Keys</h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/screenshot_20190420-081150.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Since we are road tripping the entire east coast, we decided to go down the chain of islands on Highway 1, explore a little, and ride it all the way up to Maine (when activities permit).\u00a0\u00a0 Today was the day for the island life!\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_122537.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>In the morning, we set out with cloudy skies, and the water was a\nbrilliant blue around the highway. There\nwere tons of cars heading south with us and I was so confused because I thought\nthere wouldn\u2019t be any parking for ALL of us. \nCome to find out, some would duck out into the pull-off spaces to go\nboating, picnicking, set up sun tents and hang out, etc. Super cool!</p>\n\n<h2>Last Starbucks for 80 Miles</h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_091338.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Ready to get the creative editing juices flowing, we pulled into\nthe last Starbucks for the next 80 miles and went to work. Chad\u2019s mom was celebrating a birthday and we\nwanted to create a little cartoon to share with her. It was one of my favorite editing sessions!</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/B3SGDJDq\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Straight to Key West</h2>\n\n<p>We did the \u201cwalk-it-with-your-eyes\u201d tour of the islands all the\nway down to Key West. There wasn\u2019t\nreally a decided plan on where we would be staying for the night (snag a hotel\nfor over $400 minimum on Easter Weekend for a night; sleep in the residential\nareas of the Keys; find an RV park\u2026) and kind of left that to the other side to\nhelp us out.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_145513.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_150413.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_150620.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>My favorite part of the drive was seeing the blue water, following\nthe rusty abandoned bridge alongside us, watching the water activities going on\nand seeing the beach-life tourism. My perception\nof the Keys used to be a serene vaca destination with little huts, vegetation,\nold town spaces and a really chill environment. \nOops. There was a CVS almost\neverywhere I looked, large big-name stores, fast food, TONS of cars and\nconcrete everywhere. The island of Key\nWest is one giant cement block with a sprinkling of vegetation. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_151216.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_151323.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_155531.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad and I walked the main strip of Key West, ran into a little\nart fair on the streets, and looped the whole island on foot. It was tons of walking, but we put 8 hours on\nthe parking garage limit and planned to use it all up. There was no free on street parking that we\ncould find and it was metered. THERE\nWERE SO MANY CARS. Ok, enough about cars. We also saw the most southern point of the continental\nU.S.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_152203-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_154200.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_153353-1.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Key Lime Pie in Key West</h2>\n\n<p>It had to be done. I found\na little bakery and we tried one slice to share. The pie tasted just like the ones we have\neaten back home. Chad and I were a\nlittle bummed to know that there wasn\u2019t a special \u201cknock your socks off\u201d\ndifference with the recipes. Oh well. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_144950.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>There was a little beach that some people were resting on and were wading in the water.\u00a0 I realized that there was a large pipe trailing next to the pier and exiting contents into the ocean.\u00a0 This was their street water drainage system and the people were swimming in it!?\u00a0 All drains lead to the ocean people, the water is literally muddy and clouded!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_155755.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_155923.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_155900.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Little Hole in the Wall</h2>\n\n<p>We found an article mentioning the restaurants the locals go to for food instead of dropping tons of cash on the tourist trap food prices. There was a little Cuban restaurant we tried, and I really loved the cooked plantains! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_162343.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_162617.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_162852-1.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_161048.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p> We also tried their Cuban Sandwich and Conch Chowder.\u00a0 The sandwich was alright\u2026just like a subway sandwich\u2026 but the Conch chowder tasted good.\u00a0 It was like eating chili.</p>\n\n<p>Not far was an old cemetery and was saw our first iguana living with a dead person. They must share rent!</p>\n\n<ul class=\"is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_171400.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_171357.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure></li></ul>\n\n<h2>Searching for a Bench</h2>\n\n<p>After food and the busy main strip of town, we wanted a calmer environment.\u00a0 This would be a perfect time to have a bed and breakfast because then we could have chilled out on the porch or took midafternoon nap.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_155325.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_155254.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Instead, we kept walking and found a little splash pad out of the way of the chaos within a park.\u00a0 The large trees were beautiful and the cooler aid coming from the bay helped chill us out.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_174318.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>There was a large area for MASSIVE boats to dock to and we walked\nthe strip. Fooled into a dead-end, we\nwalked back through a little workout park. \nMight as well try each of the little machines!</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/VTYZaFR5\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Mile 0</h2>\n\n<p>Now we have finally found the calming spaces of the island. The residential and little condo were chill,\ngreen with shade trees and in gated communities. We snuck through the park exit into a\nwonderland! It spit us out near the\ndowntown strip and I took a pic with mile marker 0 for Highway 1.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_182712.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>Hidden Treasure</h2>\n\n<p>Making our way back to the parking garage, we walked the boarder of the island and found a whole section we almost missed!\u00a0\u00a0 These consisted of old brick roads, pirate-themed environments, restaurants on the water, shops, and a boardwalk around the marina.\u00a0 How cool!\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_185058-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_183549.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_184955-1.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_185914-1.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_183616.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Sore Feet & Thirsty</h2>\n\n<p>Time to call it. Our feet were tired and I was parched. I\u2019m sure Chad was thirsty too, but he holds\nout better than I do. We researched the\nmany forums online to see if it would even be worth our time to try car camping\non Key West. Nope. No way. All the sources talked about how the streets\nare heavily monitored for cars/vans looking like they have sleeping\noccupants. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_172742.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_171735.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/florida-keys-day-trip/20190420_182142.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>There was even an article talking about how its super bad to\nconsider parking at ANY of the shopping and grocery stores because the local\nenforcement have blocked off the exits, forcing the sleeping RVs, car campers\nand vans into tickets or getting towed. \nThey are serious (or so they say). \nWe skipped the mess of sleeping and headed back to the tip of Florida. We would rather spend the funds on activities\nand food, than blow it on a night in a hotel.</p>\n\n<h2>Ta Ta for Now</h2>\n\n<p>If we were to come back, we would fly in and spend the time in a\nB&B space. We could then vacation in\none space, take part in the water actives and beach. This trip is not a beach trip, it\u2019s a road\ntrip! Now we know where we like to go\nand scouting will pay off. </p>\n\n<h2>Repeat (Without the Frog Please)</h2>\n\n<p>Chad, bless his soul, drove us back to Florida while I worked on\nthis blog. 45 \u2013 55 MPH. It was a slow\ntrek, but understandable. We made camp\nat the Cracker Barrel we woke up at this morning. Crazy! \nThat\u2019s a first for this trip. \nWhat a long day\u2026. Thanks islands,\nwe will see you again!</p>",

We woke in a town called Homestead (just south\nof Miami) after coming back late last night from the Keys day trip. Maybe the sleep wasn\u2019t as awesome as I\nthought?</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/yzsNghjq\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>We drove passed Miami (drove through on another vacation) and Fort\nLauderdale to hit West Palm Beach with the intent to go beaching. Happy Easter! We made it onto Palm Beach and I had to use\nthe restroom. Everything was closed and\nI was mightily frustrated now. The parking by the beach was also roped off,\npolice were on each street, and they turned cars around if they went too far\nup. Huh\u2026must be an Easter marathon or beach\nevent taking place. I found a Starbucks\nthat seemed to be open, we parked the car and made our way on foot. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/easter-sunday/20190421_110851.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/easter-sunday/20190421_111422.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/easter-sunday/20190421_112354.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/easter-sunday/20190421_112520.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/easter-sunday/20190421_112119.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The environment was extremely high end and everyone around us was\nwearing their Easter Best++. We found\nthe Starbucks inside a beach-style mall with designer stores all around. I was relieved (finally) and Chad asked the\nstaff why the road was blocked off.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Trump.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh.\u00a0 I guess President Trump has a home on Palm Beach (way before he was President) and was going to be attending noon Mass (or so we were told).\u00a0 For him to get from his home to church, they must close off the road, barricade the streets and have police force keeping pedestrians out of the way of the car brigade. \u00a0\u00a0Then, there is a straight shot to church without any interruptions.\u00a0 Apparently, Trump comes to visit Palm Beach almost every other weekend in the summer, so this happens a lot.</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/8hNtyuhS\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>The Coast Guard boats patrol the waters and boat traffic must reroute\naround them. The airspace above Trump\u2019s\nhome is also protected and the major airport must divert plane routes. Thanks Starbucks for telling us the inside scoop! We had no idea. Chad and I then walked on foot to the road that\nwas blocked off and crossed to the ocean side. \nThe sand was beautiful, and I was able to touch the water. Might as well wait to see if we could see\nTrump\u2026it\u2019s so coincidental. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/easter-sunday/20190421_113846.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/easter-sunday/20190421_113911.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/easter-sunday/20190421_122113.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Later, we realized Trump had already gone to Mass and we were able\nto see him on the way back when it got out at noon. We walked as close as we could to the church\nand met another traveling couple that wanted to see what the fuss was all\nabout. Our party was told to wait 30\nfeet away from the street and could stay to watch. </p>\n\n<p>The area we stopped at was the staging area (two black, dark\nwindow tinted secret-agent-like squad cars ready to lead the way) and we\nchatted briefly with the guys sitting in the front car (completely dressed in full\ngear) and the radio went off signaling Trump was on the move. They scooted out and floored it. Then, a brigade of black vehicles came whizzing\nby. </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/OPmLQznC\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>I was able to see Trump! \u00a0Chad was recording and couldn\u2019t see firsthand but was able to see in the video later.\u00a0 What a crazy amount of secret service and military reinforcements.\u00a0 The only thing he was missing was a helicopter (maybe a cloaked, silent one was there!).\u00a0 There were probably snipers in the bushes too. \u00a0The bushes all ran away. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/easter-sunday/trump-car.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Still-shot from the video: Human eyes are much better to view with</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Below are pictures of the Church of Bethesda-By-The Sea where Trump attended Mass.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/easter-sunday/20190421_124323.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/easter-sunday/20190421_1244300.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/easter-sunday/20190421_124438.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Island Driving </h2>\n\n<p>Now feeling better and myself again, Chad and I had a pleasant\nrest of the morning looking at the homes (billionaire row was closed because of\nTrump\u2019s adventures, so maybe next time) so we went up the other way.

Uh, say what? \nWe checked out their Wal-Mart and there were signs posted there\ntoo. </p>\n\n<p>I checked the City ordinances and in 2016 they decided to prohibit\nall overnight parking, including trucks and RV campers, from retail locations\nand streets. They also have crazy\nregulations for home owners like requiring ALL commercial vehicle parking/storage\nto take place OUTSIDE of city limits, unless on a service call.

The night was hot, but it\ncooled off in the morning (perfect blanket weather) and I slept pretty\ngood. Chad\u2019s morning routine consists of\nsitting half-way up, staring blankly at his surroundings for about 10 minutes\nwithout moving and then snaps awake like a little busy squirrel (cleans his\nteeth, talks fast, cleans sleeping gear, cleans clothes and applies deodorant).\n</p>\n\n<h2>Beautiful Trees</h2>\n\n<p>Just on the outskirts of Savannah, there is a plantation-turned-state-park named Wormsloe Historic Site which hosts the oldest ruins of a home from the first Georgia settlers (in the 1700s).\u00a0 The plantation was handed down to family members and parts of the plantation are still owned by the original family (the new big house and private library).</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_110853.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>View on the way in</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>But, the unique part about the place is the long 2 mile stretch of\nlive oak trees lining the driveway. These\ntrees were planted in the 1800s to commend a birth and over 400 trees were\nplanted. I asked the ticket booth guy if\nthese were the Forest Gump trees\u2026.they aren\u2019t. lol </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_111333.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_111409.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>If you were to go in the future to see the trees, you can park the\ncar (without paying) and take some shots. \nThere is a sign that you\u2019re not supposed to take photos before you pay,\nbut you totally can. We paid to drive\ndown the tree row, see the house ruins (you aren\u2019t missing much\u2026I would recommend\njust seeing the trees) and learn a little about the plantation/area history. </p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a shot detailing the history of the plantation so you don\u2019t\nhave to go if you don\u2019t want to.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_112645.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_121011.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_121516.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_121614.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_121717.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_122431.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_122716.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_124357.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>On the way out</figcaption></figure>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/1ojUU0U9\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Dying to Get Out</h2>\n\n<p>Next, I mapped out the famous cemetery Bonaventure Cemetery and we\nwalked it. The headstones stones just\nkept going! There were small and large\nfamily plots, and even some graves saying they were confederate soldiers. I think the earliest we were able to see was in\nthe 1820s (year they were born).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_130252.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_131445.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_132102.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_132136.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_132648.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_132822.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The noon hour sun was starting to leak through the big trees and\nwe started overheating. But, we walked\nso far into the maze of rows that we had no idea where the exit was?! We found a fence and followed it out, which\nhappened to walk us by a very old part of the plot. They were dying to get in here and we were\ndying to get out of the cemetery! </p>\n\n<h2>Old Historic Savannah </h2>\n\n<p>The remaining afternoon was spent walking the little town squares\n(literally, all the blocks were perfect little squares), exploring the green\nparks (over 22 little \u201ctown squares\u201d), and taking a few tours.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_144645.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_145536.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_150115.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_151110.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p><strong>Parking: Use the Liberty Street parking Garage.\u00a0 It was only $1 an hour.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We walked through the Sorrel Weed Mansion and learned about the\nhistory of the home (as in, what terrible architecture decisions were made with\nthe different ownerships of the home since it was built in the early 1820s). There was a department store in the basement,\nupstairs rooms were converted to apartment spaces and the carriage house/slaves\u2019\nquarters were also renovated to be apartments. \nThe new non-profit is working to restore the home to its original design\n(as much as possible) and the tour fees help with the renovations. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_152502.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_153606.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_154514.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_155108.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_155818.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_160544.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_160547.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_160937.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_161627.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>At night, there are ghost tours to go on. I guess there were a few kids died in there\nfrom child birth, yellow fever and an infected broken leg; the mistress of the\nhouse committed suicide by jumping into the garden from the third floor. Also, there were plenty of slaves on the\nproperty at one point in time and it is said they hang around too.</p>\n\n<h2>Aye, Maatie!\u00a0 Stolen people, you say?</h2>\n\n<p>I had read online that there was Pirate\u2019s House Restaurant that\nwas said to have had a tunnel underneath that would transport stolen people\nonto the boats during the pirating time. \nChad and I walked almost out town near the bay/river and came across an\nold looking house. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_172311.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The house wasn\u2019t much (old and wooden) but there were buildings attached\nto it which seemed to be the restaurant. \nJust as we were going to go in, a massive tour bus started unloading ALL\nof the older people from what might have been the casino or retirement\ncommunity. With the flood of people, we\nducked upstairs (into the new gift shop..ew) and went back downstairs. </p>\n\n<p>At that time, there happened to be a lady pirate coming in from\nthe bar. \u201cAye, a fellow ginger. Do you\nabide by the Ginger Code?! Stay out of the sun, live in sunscreen and embrace\nthe pale skin!\u201d</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_164719.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We took a private tour of the restaurant and walked around the different\nsections of the site. The original house\nwas the pirate\u2019s bar and sleeping area/hotel (1 room with cots on the floor). Underneath was the root cellar to store booze\nand food. But, there was also a secret\nunderground tunnel that lead to the harbor. \nDuring the pirating days, crews sometimes were low on volunteers, so\nthey got creative. They bribed the bartender\nto turn a blind eye, they and would put opium and laudanum into the drinks of the\nbar patrons. After they hit the floor,\ndead out, they would wake up on the boat \u201cthree sheets to the wind\u201d, would have\n\u201chang over\u201d the side of the ship for a while with sickness and would have to\nserve as the slave crew.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_172143.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>A cop at the time wanted to bust the bar, so he sat down, took a\ndrink and woke up on a boat. Drat! He spent\ntwo years trying to make his way back to the states and when he did (he made\nit!), he brought fellow police and shut them down. </p>\n\n<p>Fast forward\u2026empty house\u2026a rich guy bought the whole row of homes\u2026made\na restaurant and merged all of the buildings into a dinning experienced (his\nwife couldn\u2019t let the city tear down the history) and tada! They added an extra\ntoilet within the last 20 years to the ladies room and it went right on through\nthe floor into a large hole. They found\na cannon ball! Maybe a hideaway place for\nthe underground railway!?</p>\n\n<h2>No Carmel for Katie</h2>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_172522.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_172631.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_172855.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_173050.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We walked the rivers edge (cute little market space and real old\nstone roads) and there happened to be a candy store I was interested in. While day dreaming about what caramels to\nget, remembering the taste and thinking about sugar, I went head-over-heels\nonto the sidewalk. I don\u2019t know how, but\nmy foot caught the gutter going downhill and I lost my footing. I guess I was literally\nsupposed to drop the idea of candy and \u201croll\u201d onto the next adventure.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_173309.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_173437.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_173451.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_174242.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_174840.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_174939.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_1751520.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Pass the Vinaigrette & Oil</h2>\n\n<p>Enough with the tourist food prices and greasy meals, where\u2019s the greens?\u00a0 Chad and I headed out of downtown Savannah to a local Publix and purchased ingredients to make massive salad.\u00a0\u00a0 While Chad cut out an empty water jug, I prepped the salad ingredients.\u00a0 MMMM.\u00a0 We each had three massive servings and finished everything!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_193859.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-savannah/20190423_194334.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>South Carolina</h2>\n\n<p>We crossed the border around 10 p.m. and settled in for sleep at a\nPilot truck stop. Chad spotted our first\narmadillo! He was scooting around the\nfence and finally popped out onto outside. The southern possum! </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/JVfMnjKQ\">Watch Video</a></div>",

    "content": "<p>Day 24: More southern hospitality, please! Charleston, South Carolina is the main attraction today and we didn\u2019t have any specific plans/places in mind to visit. We woke at a Pilot Gas Station about an hour out of Charleston early in the morning, but it took a few hours to get going. Just groggy and slow. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_101230.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<blockquote><p>Chad, I\u2019m hungry.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get you some lettuce. I\u2019ve been thinking about getting lettuce for a while.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you</strong> \ud83d\ude0a </p>\n\n<p>The drive in was gorgeous! \nThe trees are so tall and green\u2026they look like giant asparagus stalks\n(can you tell I\u2019m hungry haha everything reminds me of food).</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_101523.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>Queen Street Grocery</h2>\n\n<p>First stop in town -&gt; food. \nI found a forum detailing a day spent in Charleston and they mentioned\nto grab a hot-pressed sandwich from an old grocery store. Sweet. \n</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_122950.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p><strong>Parking: Charleston County Parking Garage; $1.25 per hour</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://queenstreetgrocerycafe.com/\">Queen Street Grocery</a>, established in 1921, hosted a diner-like setting and fridges for cold beverages.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t a grocery store any longer, but they are known for their hot-pressed sandwiches and crepes. We sampled their <em>Tenacious Turkey </em>sandwich (nummy bread, sprouts, melted brie cheese, sauce, shaved turkey) and it was pretty good.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_122420.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_123859.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_124048.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>If this place was back home, it would say it would be my other regular place that I would attend, besides from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BernBaums/\">Bern Baums</a> (which, by the way, is my FAVORITE food place EVER because of the gourmet, house-made kosher bagels, unique atmosphere and ever-changing menu. They just opened inside their new location on Broadway in Fargo. It\u2019s a must. Go visit! The Icelantic (salmon+lox+capers+pickled cucumbers) is where it\u2019s at). Woof, appreciation rant over.</p>\n\n<h2>Strolling Calhoun</h2>\n\n<p>Chad loves to go running and hang out at Lake Calhoun in\nMinneapolis (who doesn\u2019t?) and today we were able to walk on Calhoun\nStreet. Miss home much? Yes, a little. Charleston had a little lake and we stopped\nto rest on a bench. We took a virtual\ntour of a mansion, so we didn\u2019t have to physically walk there and pay tourist\nprices. It was a relaxing space. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_124751.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_124836.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Charleston Architecture</h2>\n\n<p>The homes here are stunning, are adorned with porches and have a\nwide variety of greenery in all of the yards. \nThe streets smelled of flowers and some of the areas had crazy large\nmansions. The bigger the balconies and\nfront entries, the more impressive the whole thing seemed. We walked up and down many streets taking it\nin.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_124528.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_124711.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_125935.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_130136.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_130301.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_133218.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Esspresso</h2>\n\n<p>The forum also mentioned to grab a cup of coffee from <a href=\"https://secondstatecoffee.com/\">Second State Coffee</a> and we did.\u00a0 We tried their Cortado (2 shots espresso + 1 shot milk) and their drip coffee.\u00a0\u00a0 Now satiated with liquid after a hot walk outside, we ventured back into the heat to check out the old market place downtown. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_134313.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_134632.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_135429.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>University Discussions & Shopping </h2>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_142125.jpg\" /><p>Chad and I rested in the court yard within the University of Charleston on a bench to wear off the caffeinated thoughts. We then ventured down the streets filled with shopping centers and down to the water front. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_142121.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_143134.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The space was pleasantly occupied with people, not too much or too little, and it made the experience more enjoyable. We popped into an art gallery and I drew a cartoon of Chad searching for bagels (I would secretly like a bagel but I\u2019m waiting for New England to indulge).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_150452.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_150539.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_144628-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_144945-1.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_145305.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_145908.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_150924.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_151212.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Dinner!!!!!!</h2>\n\n<p>We made a pit stop at a local grocery store and purchased salad materials. Tonight\u2019s meal consisted of spinach, mixed lettuce, avocado, cucumbers, and sardines accented with olive oil and vinaigrette. I run just fine off veggies and can keep my energy levels high. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_151407.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_151849.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_152124.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_152617.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_152635.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_153835.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad on the other hand, uses energy much faster than I do and we can tell when he is running out because he gets crabby, quiet, and conserves his movements. He needs more calories than lettuce can offer! Meanwhile, I am bouncing around with energy and can constantly out-talk him (scary).</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_182533.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_161242.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_161446.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_161450.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad\u2019s beard is getting longer!! \nIt\u2019s been 24 days and he is starting to look more like himself again (I\u2019m\nnot riding in a car with a stranger any more). \nWe were listening to Rock\u2019n Roll Jesus \u2026. what appropriate timing. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_185422.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>New Scenery</h2>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_185800.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>On the way to Mytrle Beach</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>We hit the road in the late afternoon and headed towards Myrtle Beach to camp out at a Cracker Barrel. We had dinner inside (yay!) and tried their meat loaf, chicken and dumplings, ham, and veggie sides. There brussels sprout and kale salad was SO GOOD. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_205048.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>It tastes like broccoli salad from back home. Chad always enjoys their biscuits (but Hardy\u2019s apparently has the best biscuits and gravy) and the waitress actually gave us a \u00bd dozen to go! Say whattt?? Lol Chad said we will have to go find a Hardy\u2019\u2019s and get some gravy for these puppies. Thank you!</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/charleston-landscaping/20190424_201046.jpg\" alt=\"\" />",

    "content": "<p>Day 25: Travel day! We are heading out to the mountains in North\nCarolina to visit a massive mansion, see the large forests and maybe some waterfalls. To get there, we crossed South Carolina starting\nat Myrtle Beach and hopped a few highways heading up, up, up.</p>\n\n<h2>Beach Waves</h2>\n\n<p>First stop, Myrtle Beach, SC (before the strong sun rays shine\ndown)! We slept outside just outside of\ntown at a Cracker Barrel and I was stoked to try beaching again. It was chilly (maybe low 70s) and we found\nsome free parking a little away from the major Myrtle Beach (Surfside Beach). They also had a shower pole! Perfect!</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_090626.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The water was COLD! But, once\nwe got in and were drenched by the massive waves, it was pretty warm (maybe\nbecause we were a little numb???). Chad\nsubmerged himself and was scrubbing his body viciously. \u201cChad, what are you doing?\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI\u2019m scrubbing my nethers! Aren\u2019t you cleaning?? You are supposed to be cleaning, this is your bath time and you\u2019re playing in the water!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_090927.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Chad then was partially hit by a large wave; serves him right\nhaha. The water was so refreshing and\nthe waves were awesome to play in. We\ntried to body surf but would end up mostly tossed around and smacked pretty\ngood. I stood talking to Chad with my finger\npointed in the air \u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2026.\u201d \nWHAM. Hit was a medium-sized\nwave, I was caught off guard and Chad died laughing. He saw the whole thing coming haha.</p>\n\n<p>We showered up on shore and Chad mentioned he really like this\nbeach a lot. \u201chuh, maybe that\u2019s because\nit\u2019s early and all of the older people are on the beach. It\u2019s so quiet. Yep, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s the older people that\nmake it better.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Chad, now hungry for the biscuits in the backseat, searched for a\nHardy\u2019s nearby. We ended up monkeying\naround town with traffic and we accidently missed the breakfast time\u2026.it ends\nat 11 a.m. and Chad went into a massive disappointment session. We are talking the silent treatment, for\nhimself lol. He didn\u2019t say anything and\nwe navigated to a grocery store.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_130712.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Bye bye stale biscuits, hello the best salad ever. We bought a package of cooked shrimp to thaw\non the dash while we continued driving. \nI found a little park to eat at within a small town and we picnicked. It was SO GOOD. Chad felt better after eating and mentioned he\nhad set expectations of having the biscuits...that\u2019s why expectations are bad\nlol. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_130737.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p><em>Pictured: Spinach, shredded cabbage, avocado, cucumber, shrimp, vinaigrette, and olive oil.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Travel Time</h2>\n\n<p>I drove and drove and drove. Chad ended up taking a little 45 minute nap while I listed to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch\">Joe Rogan podcast about early humans</a> (fascinating stuff there). </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_140158-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>For dinner, we visited Costco and picked up a bird. Chad was ravenous and ate 75% of it. I was still content with the salad and shrimps. For dessert, we made fruit parfaits with bananas, clementines, and apples. YUM. We also stalked up on 6 gallons of water (only $5 !?) </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_160557-2.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_163214.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Mountains </h2>\n\n<p>We hit the mountains close to dusk and made camp in a local truck stop called Mountain Energy Truck Stop. Lol creative name y\u2019all. There were other car campers (the kind that maybe do this for real??) and the cars were all older. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_182029.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I think our car was the newest in the entire parked lot! There was a DQ attached to the gas station, so we parked really close to the drive through and nobody bothered us because they were so concerned about where to enter the drive through, they never looked around. Perfect.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_182057.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_182746.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_182808.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_182817.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/shrimp-salad/20190425_1845070.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We were expecting rain in the early morning but left the windows\ncracked anyway. It was hot and we were\nhopping the temp would drop soon. The car was parked on a hilly slope and our\nheads were sloping down. Uh oh. But, don\u2019t worry. With a pillow propped under our heads and the\nseats tiled just right, it was like sleeping in a lazy boy. Night night! </p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 26: Woof, what a place. The Biltmore Estate we toured was built in 1889 and I remembered my family on my dad\u2019s side had just stepped off the boat through the Great Lakes during around this time period and were setting up their farm in northern Minnesota. Talk about two different worlds! Lol my family was just immigrating and starting again as a farming family while this other family was living off of the splendor of the steamboat and railway investments their grandparents had made. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPD6YiBFG1Q\n</div></figure>\n\n<p>Chad and I woke from the Mountain Energy truck stop and rode 20 minutes into Asheville. Travel tunes above lol Who knew these limp biscuits even were a big thing!? ;) Who even likes wet bread?? To break the trip up, I picked a new station on Slacker and never knew that rock could be pleasant to listen too. All these rock songs from the 2000s could be sung by little kids and they would suddenly sound so happy and friendly.\u00a0 Maybe the new genre of music could be the Rat Pack (60s) or Reggae. </p>\n\n<p>We pulled into a Starbucks to snag some wifi from the parking lot (weak signal) and I ended up hot spotting to post.\u00a0 (No outside drinks in the estate, please!)\u00a0 Chad tried to get tickets online (you get a free audio-guided tour!!) but the online credit card purchasing site was down.\u00a0 He called in and over-the-phone purchasing was down too.\u00a0 Uh oh.\u00a0 Well, to the main gate we go.</p>\n\n<h2>Entering the Estate</h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_105115.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>There were cars everywhere and lined up like ants to get into the entrance. We walked inside the ticket cottage and there\nwas a nice older gentleman that was able to help us get our tickets ahead of\nthe lines. Somehow the online purchasing\nworked on Chad\u2019s phone and we were able to snag the free audio-guided tour! THIS\nIS A MUST. Otherwise, get an actual tour\nwith someone to tell you about the house/family. Otherwise, you will literally miss out on\nEVERYTHING.</p>\n\n<h2>First, Food</h2>\n\n<p>Online, we purchased a buffet lunch at Deer Park Restaurant and\nthey opened at 11 a.m. The older\ngentleman suggested we head straight there and then we get the first pick of\nthe day! You don\u2019t have to tell us twice!\n We happened to be there on a Friday and\nthat is their specialty day featuring the <em>Taste\nof the South</em> menu of regional specialties. \nField-to-table, here we come!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_111439.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_112042.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Our waitress was super helpful during the meal and we were able try sweet tea, a special strawberry lemonade (her favorite and we now understand why!), salads, meats, veggies, breads and desserts. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_110805.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_115203.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_115159.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_112809.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_112715.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_120823.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We asked her what her favorite dessert was and she leaned in secretly to tell us her favorite was the truffles (they also change out the fillings, making it a surprise bite!). But, the truffles are not out on the table. They are for special occasions only. She asked if we were celebrating anything like a birthday or anniversary\u2026.sadly, no. She walked away saying, \u201cwe can do something about that\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_121416.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_110244.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_122921.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_110023.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_124247.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>She came back out with a cutting board freshly written with chocolate sauce and two little truffles glued to the board with newly cooled melted chocolate. The two little round balls were also just glazed with a decorative gold paint. THEY WERE SO GOOD!! For sure handmade. Somewhere. Thank you! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_124702.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_130128.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We were so full from our meal and we enjoyed the salad fixings the\nmost. It was like we were able to have a\n7 course meal just like they would have served at the estate back in the\nday! As we were about to leave, the wind\nkicked up and rain started dropping in sheets. \nHard. Um??? We waited for a break\nand dashed to the car. It was now\nperfect timing to go check out the gardens! </p>\n\n<h2>Rolling Hills, Trees & Gardens</h2>\n\n<img src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_131954-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>When the 125,000 acres of land were purchased, the surrounding hills were in pretty poor condition. Vanderbilt hired a forester and together they planned the horticulture for the rolling hills to help the land become fertile again. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_133351.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_1320090.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_134122.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_133708.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_172836.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The family is known for replanting, farming and reestablishing the timber forests in the area to improve the overall quality of life for everyone. The forests were managed, and they established the first forestry education program in the U.S., the <em>Biltmore Forest School</em>, in 1898. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_132413.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_132751.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_133258.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_133417.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_133517.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Over 75 acres of formal gardens surround the home estate and the plants were gorgeous. Vanderbilt sent horticulturists around the nation and to other countries to bring back specimens for the gardens to host. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_134827.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_134934.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_135029.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_135114.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_135330.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_135133.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>There was a special redwood tree we saw in the garden and the sign said it was thought the specific species was extinct, but a grove was found in the depths of China forests not too long ago. Maybe this tree came from that grove! How crazy! These plants are from all over the place!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_135926.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_135704.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/welcome-to-the-gilded-age/20190426_135340.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Happy and SUPER full from lunch, we walked the garden trails. We crossed bridges (wooden and stone), went\nup and down hills, climbed grassy knolls, and walked to a man-made lake (just\ndammed a little to allow for a little paddle boating).

    "content": "<p>Day 27: Why not fly through\nthe Blue Ridge Mountains on a zipline? \nIt\u2019s a lot faster than hiking \ud83d\ude0a. But first, coffee. Chad and I spent the night at, you guessed\nit, Cracker Barrel and we woke to see three parked police cars in the lot. Good morning angels! I walked in to use the restroom and two of\nthem were playing checkers on the front porch. On the way back, I did a lap\naround the building so they wouldn\u2019t see me walking back to our camper (lol hi,\njetta). </p>\n\n<p>Moving the car across the street to a grocery store, we prepped\nfor the morning spraying some of our clothes with 90% isopropyl alcohol (gotta\nprevent stinky humans!), tidying the car, and cleaning ourselves. Wet wipes anyone?</p>\n\n<h2>Specialty Drinks</h2>\n\n<p>I searched online for unique coffee shops in downtown Asheville and found an article detailing <a href=\"https://www.tradeandlore.com/coffee-asheville-nc\">Trade and Lore Coffee</a> makes specialty syrups, flavors and has soda coffee. Say what?? Done. </p>\n\n<p>The morning streets were quiet and the GPS lead us to an older\npart of town. The shop was located on\nWall Street and there was a massive old flat iron statue on the corner. I\u2019m feeling a little \u2018pressed\u2019 for time, so I\ndidn\u2019t stay long.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190427_090459/\"><img src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_090459.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p>We tried their pistachio and hopscotch lattes. MMM the pistachio was so rich and I liked that one the most. The hopscotch had splash of butterscotch and other tastes I couldn\u2019t place; I would order this by itself because the pistachio flavors were so strong.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_091256-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_091310.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_091508.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_120343.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_120404.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad was able to catch up with some friends back home and talked\n90 miles an hour because of the caffeine. I attempted to upload the MANY photos\nof the Biltmore Estate from the previous day\u2019s tour to a post, but the internet\nwas so slow. We ended up having to pack\nup and head to our next destination.</p>\n\n<h2>Tree Hopping</h2>\n\n<p>As recommended by friends in Florida, we signed up for a ziplining\ntree canopy tour in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. Woof. \nThe mountains aren\u2019t as large (or they don\u2019t feel like it anyway) as the\nmountains we passed through on the west coast trip in Colorado. These mountains just look like massive\nrolling hills covered in greenery.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_123216.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We went to <a href=\"https://www.navitat.com/asheville-nc/\">Navitat</a> for the day adventure. Two guides, three couples and one van driver piled into a large Ford passenger van to take us to the first zipline. Holy buckets. The road was absolutely steep. The gravel underneath seemed like it was slipping underneath the tires and the driver casually chatted with one of the guests in the passenger seat. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_124327.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_130455.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_130622.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, it was a short van ride, but it was directly up. Unbelievably up. The tight corners seemed impossible, but we made it around each time. It was like one of those hills you would attack with a snowmobile and without momentum, you would fall backwards. This was that feeling. Gunning it would only spin the tires on the loose gravel. Please don\u2019t roll backwards down the mountain!</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cShould we start praying, Chad?\u201d I asked. Chad replied with, \u201cit\u2019s a little too late for that\u2026\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I had the window seat and looking over the edge, it was a legit\nedge. No support rails, no pitstops,\nonly one way up, no turning around\u2026.gulp. Trees and shrubs were the only\ncompanions that would <em>maybe</em> stop us\nfrom rolling all the way back to base camp. </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>On the last curve the driver started repeating the phrase, \u201cthink light thoughts. I am a balloon. I am as light as a feather,\u201d while he gunned it up the only cemented portion of the steepest hill. </p></blockquote>\n\n<p>We made it to the top and spilled out grateful to make it on solid\nground. Cheese! The view was spectacular, my cortisol was\nspiked.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_131730.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>First Zip</h2>\n\n<p>I happened to be hooked in to go first and all was well until the\nradio signal from the lady guide reported the line was clear to send me. My stomach dropped a little. I\u2019ve zipped a little before in a ropes course\nin Florida five years ago, but I completely forgot the feeling of flying\nthrough the air. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_131744.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_132005.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_132011.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_132701.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_133320.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>My feet left the platform and I whizzed through the air. Silence. </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/qLu5m6Nd\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>A small buzzing from the wire was the only background noise. The\nsurrounding mountains were gorgeous, and I wanted to stop in the middle of the\nline and really take it all in. No\nnerves, no jitters, no nothing. I was in\nawe of the trees, mountain hills and the blue sky. Wow, what a stunning day to be out in the\ntrees.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/blue-ridge/start-line-zip.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/tYjq9QMJ\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>2.5 Hours </h2>\n\n<p>We spent the afternoon clipping into six different lines, talking\nabout the varieties of plants we saw and joking around. During the zip we\ncrossed rope bridges, scaled a spiral tree staircase and finished with\nrappelling to the forest floor. Our\nguides, Bob and Stephanie, were fun, laid back and great to work with. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_133336.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_133438.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_133459.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_134846.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_135720.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Stephanie reminded everyone that we could use our outside voices\nand yell while we zipped. </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I responded with \u201cI think I\u2019ll save my outside voice for help. I\u2019ll save my help voice.\u201d </p></blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/TrSCoxGx\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>Chad chatted with Bob often and we were able to hear about one of\nhis ziplining horror stories. Bob said\nthere was a lady that had brought someone\u2019s ashes on the zip and she let them\nloose while she went across. But, the\nwind brought the ashes back and hit Bob in the face (yes, he has now tasted\ndeath!). He didn\u2019t know she was going to\ndo this and had no idea what hit him!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_143257.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_144335.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_145037.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_145353.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_150853.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad asked about what the procedure is for when people are scared\nand don\u2019t want to continue. From that\nquestion, Bob said his best story he has is when a girl was cromiting. What is\ncromitng you ask? I guess it is crying\nand vomiting at the same time. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_144341.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/sKUZCch3\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>There was a girl who went with her boyfriend and he made her keep\ngoing from line to line even though she had tears in her eyes. Eventually, the tears merged with vomiting\nand she zipped in as a massive mess. Ick.</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/VQttaKuA\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Bonding Time Over</h2>\n\n<p>We finished the tour and Chad was having great conversations with\nBob about duel sport motorcycles. He was\nsharing he wanted to trailer with some friends out to Oklahoma and ride these\nbikes on scenic dirt roads all through the west. Bob said he would feel comfortable riding 80\nmph on loose gavel backroads. That\u2019s\nabsolutely a different world than we are used to with our Harley Touring Bikes\n(we are skittish of loose gravel so we don\u2019t dump on a turn). Super fun to learn about a different way to\ntravel the country. </p>\n\n<p>Now we have to do a Harley trip! \nBye, Bob. Thanks for the advice\nand thoughts.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Chad\u2019s thought of the zipline: \u201cIt was fun to knock it off the bucket list!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<h2>Blue Ridge Mountains</h2>\n\n<p>Taking the suggestion of Bob, we made our way using some back\nroads to get access to the Blue Ridge Mountains Highway. We made it halfway up the mountains (dueling\nbanjos, anyone???) and the road was closed. \nThe rains must have washed it out pretty good yesterday. Turning around, we backtracked and decided to\nget out of town. There will be more\nmountains! No need to get stuck and have\nto spend the night in a sketchy mountain cabin/home\u2026..NEVER lol. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_155556.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_160439.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_162042.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Dinner for Two</h2>\n\n<p>We pulled into McDonald\u2019s (it\u2019s not what you are thinking lol) and\nI used their WiFi to post all of the pictures from the previous day. Finally, fast interest! Meanwhile, Chad mapped out new places to\nvisit.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_182119.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_182907.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_183156.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_183226.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We made another nummy salad with spinach, kale, cucumbers, tomatoes,\nan avocado, sardines olive oil, vinaigrette and sea salt. Oh. So. Good. I had three tubs and Chad matched me. Dinner\ntonight was $7 per person (including costs for ingredients we already had). </p>\n\n<h2>Pit Stop</h2>\n\n<p>After food, we found ourselves heading towards Johnson City,\nTennessee and came across a scenic overlook. \nThere was a massive hill and we decided to run up it. Holy Toledo. Out of breath. That\u2019s like a 12% grade (I don\u2019t know lol all\nI know is that it was steep!)</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_195825.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_200551.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_200820.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_201143.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/bBxcJEQ1\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_201204.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_201304.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_201310.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_201412.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_201734.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Rest on a Ledge</h2>\n\n<p>Romantic setting for two on the highest ledge in town overlooking\nthe city: check. Cracker Barrel happened\nto be on a mountain side and we camped for the night overlooking the shops\nbelow and twinkling lights far out. The\nair was chilly and we used our blankets for once and cracked the windows. There was rain in the forecast for the\nevening - car wash for Hall! Night\nnight! </p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/blue-ridge/20190427_214521-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>",

We slept\nin until around 9:30 a.m. at a Cracker Barrel on the ledge overlooking Roanoke.\n</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_091326.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_091425.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_101415.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Mission Objectives</h2>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/civil-war/eric-virginia.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Thanks, Eric!</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>When we did get on the road, we set the GPS for an old swinging\nbridge in Buchanan while I set up my desk to blog. Chad and I listened to more rock to keep us\ncompany. Hall, the car, turned 20 today\nwith 20,000 miles! </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/aAiEY8Fj\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/0CMkDq6k\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>Chad also scared the crap out of me while I was blogging and he got such a great kick out of it that he did it again\u2026.on camera. That\u2019s twice now! Huuurrr-rough.</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/Q92ngzhq\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Old Swinging Bridge</h2>\n\n<p>Rolling into town, there was a sign on the highway stating that traffic\nmight be slow at 10 a.m. Thinking we\nmissed it, we kept going. We found out\nthat the town was having their Civil War reenactment that weekend and we were\ncoming to town at the tail end of it. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_114018.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_124903.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_124932.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_125514.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_125535.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cChad, I hope your ready. Looks like you\u2019re going be volunteered into the Civil War!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Free parking was over by the river and we parked next to the old bridge. It looked super sketchy next to the sturdy bridge everyone drives on today. No more than 3 people can be on the old one at a time. Uh\u2026.. </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/h1U5PkbN\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_125642.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_130004.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_130024.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_130117.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_130157.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/7Gi9D6fZ\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>It was so windy and the bridge moved like crazy under our feet as we walked. It was a cool experience, until we realized the boards looked pretty worn and some could break under our feet at any moment. \ud83d\ude0a Kinda stupid, but it was a lot of fun and I think it is something you have to experience.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_130937.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_131501.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_132603.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_133857.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_134247.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_135044.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We hung out in a <a href=\"https://www.virginia.org/listings/Dining/TheBuchananFountainGrille/\">1940s soda fountain diner</a> that served burgers, sandwiches and ice cream for lunch. Chad and I shared their cheese burger basket and the biscuits and gravy. Chad chatted with the older manager about the search for the best biscuits and gravy and they hit it off on recipe chatting. </p>\n\n<p>I splurged and ordered a banana split for us to share in the old\ndiner. It\u2019s just something you\u2019ve got to\ndo in one of these places. Yum! Chad wasn\u2019t sure the last time he had a split\nand the lady who served us said she forgot our toppings. She felt so bad and quickly drizzled the\nfinishing touches on the ice cream and we were treated to special caramel sauce\nto jazz it up.</p>\n\n<h2>Battle of Buchanan </h2>\n\n<p>Finishing our lunch, Chad heard huge <a href=\"http://www.townofbuchanan.com/history/civil-war-comes-to-buchanan%E2%80%A6-2/\">explosions from the reenactment</a> and soon we wandered down to the city park where there was an open field with people dressed in military outfits. There were cannons, rifles, horses, swords and men running around trying to fight each other. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_135315.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_135319.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_135334.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_135909.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_135912.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>It was the most interesting thing I have seen today. (Chad did hear some of the guys laughing while they fake smacked each other with swords \ud83d\ude0a). What a serendipitous moment we should arrive when this was taking place!</p>\n\n<h2>Blue Ridge Mountains</h2>\n\n<p>We drove through the Blue Ridge Parkway mountain highway to get to\na hiking trail head that would lead us to the Apple Orchard Falls. (tight\nsnatchbacks \u2013 cough, I mean switch backs \u2013 were everywhere and sometimes Chad\u2019s\nstomach dropped as he would look over the ledge while navigating the borderless\nroads. The mountain valleys were intense and vast).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_142012.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_1420200.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_142127.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p> It was midday, with plenty\nof light left to go on an adventure and we bounded down the rocky trail. Hopping from rock to rock, it was all fun and\ngames until we realized we would have to climb back up this steep slope coming\nback to the car. </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/0esttlJK\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>The trail crossed over <em>the</em>\nAppalachian Trail and I couldn\u2019t imagine hiking over 2,000+ miles! I would need some serious training and the\nright kind of gear. Down and down we went into a crevice on a mountain side and\nwe finally ended up at a large waterfall at the bottom.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_145019.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_145517.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_145523.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_145707.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_150430.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_151958.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The climb back to the top was hard work for me and Chad made it\nseem effortless. My buns, thighs and\ncalves were burning with the many stairs, rocks and steep inclines. We\u2019ll go for a few more hikes and I\u2019ll be\nfine. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_151937.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_152006.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_152302.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_152429.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_152518.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_153259.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_153322-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_153354.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_153403.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_153417.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>At the end of the climb, I noticed Chad had some cool looking\nsweat drops on this shoulders and chest. \nBut they wouldn\u2019t brush off. They were little clear mound of water.\nAfter having previously researched heat rash for myself back in Florida, I recognized\nChad had a current case of clogged pores filled with trapped sweat. Poor guy had heat rash! He scrubbed up back in the car and hopefully\nthat won\u2019t happen again. </p>\n\n<h2>The Natural Land Bridge State Park</h2>\n\n<p>Back in Kansas City at the Art Museum, we saw a painting of a land\nbridge from somewhere in Virginia. I thought\nthat was cool and never thought I was going to be able to see it. Chad, on the other hand, had decided in him\nmind that one day he was going to see it and it would most likely be on this trip! Well, how cool is that?</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_172357.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_172648.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_172722.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_172846.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_172520.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The lighting was hard because the sun was setting, but the massive\nrock cavern was hard to even fit on the phone screen. A highway even runs across the top to this\nday and it\u2019s sturdy! We jogged on the\nmile trail to the end to see a waterfall and traded piggyback carrying each\nother parts of the way. There was a yoga\nsession on a cement bridge and a few sprinting bursts on the way back to the\nstarting point.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_174201.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_174626.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_174630.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_174645.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_174733.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The natural land bridge was unique, and I can\u2019t believe it exists after\nall the potential harmful things humans could have done to it. George Washington used to own the space and\neven had a little cabin there to hang out at. Only $8 per person (free parking),\nwhy not see something amazing?</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/nZDJUMQ5\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_175137.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_180151.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_180411.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_180752.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_180800.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_180906.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_180947.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/civil-war/20190428_181718.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Dinner on the Stove</h2>\n\n<p>EEEEEEE! We used the MSR cookstove to boil water for our\nMREs. Yipppeee! So, I planned a meal of dehydrated mac n\u2019\ncheese, biscuits and gravy, and for dessert, apple crisp.

Somehow the WiFi is better at Burger King and\nI finished up the blog from yesterday. \nChad recommended also writing blog 28 because we don\u2019t know where the\nnext connection point will be. Double whammy!\n</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 29: We woke up in Lexington, Virginia with the intention of\nhiking to Crabtree Falls, but it was really chilly out. Grey skies and potential rain changed our\nminds and we hit the road. Some other\ntime, perhaps! My dad recommended a restaurant\nin Staunton called the Mill Street Grill because of the old stone and wood beam\ninfrastructure. Sounded super nifty, but\nthey didn\u2019t open until 4 p.m. and it was only 9 a.m. (20 minutes away, we\nweren\u2019t waiting for that either). </p>\n\n<h2>Lunch Time</h2>\n\n<p>Out of luck on our little adventures, we headed to the next big\ndestination. The grocery store. We stopped in one of the smaller towns off\nthe side of I-81 and went into the Lion. \nWe purchased fixings for our salads and made them in the car. We both\nhad constant headaches and wondered if it was from the MREs the night before??</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_123540-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_124040.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_124746.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I dripped one small drip of sardine oil onto my NEW, NEVER WORN ON THE TRIP hiking pants and had a little melt down.\u00a0 Someone needs a nap.\u00a0 So, I did.\u00a0 About 40 minutes later, Chad ate all the salad fixings and I woke feeling a little better.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_123619.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_123718.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_130619.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_132153.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The pit of despair is knowing it could have been avoided, that it was one of my most clean pieces of clothing, AND I currently don\u2019t have the means of washing it thoroughly.\u00a0 Hurumph. </p>\n\n<h2>Battle Fields</h2>\n\n<p>The Battle of Manassas, also known as the First Battle of Bull\nRun, took place close to Washington, D.C., and was considered the first major\nbattle of the Civil War in 1861. We did\na driving tour of the different fields used for the battle and wandered the\ngrounds (sparingly, we were saving our feet for walking in D.C.).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_142226.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_140546.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_141745.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_142056.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Instead of catching a walking tour, we were able to watch a longer\nmovie detailing the events of the war. \nThe cinematography was detailed and the actors were dressed in the\ndifferent uniforms of the men who fought in the different regiments. We left the theater feeling somber and could\nfeel the heavy weight of death as we walked to the car (which was part of the\nbattlefield were it all happened). The\nsouls and earth still mourn while nature renews itself to help clear the energies.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190429_142059/\"><img src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_142059.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<h2>Entering Washington, D.C.</h2>\n\n<p>I had reached out to one of my college friends, Lisa, to ask about\nplaces to see while in D.C. because she had been interning/working there\nstudying law.

</h3>\n\n<h2>Dinner at Ted\u2019s</h2>\n\n<p>Taking the suggestion from my friend Lisa, I mapped us to <a href=\"http://www.tedsbulletin.com/menu/\">Ted\u2019s Bulletin</a>.\u00a0 We parked a few blocks away in a residential neighborhood (2-hour free parking) and made our way to the main strip of businesses.\u00a0 The homes were skinny and right next to each other, reminding me of San Fran homes.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190429_201352/\"><img src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_201352.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p>Walking into Ted\u2019s was like going back in time.\u00a0 The front section had a pastry display and bar seating; in the back we could order a sit-down dinner.\u00a0 I hoofed it to the back and we were served by a friendly waitress, Dejah, who was absolutely thrilled we were road tripping.\u00a0 We chatted for a little bit about where we have been on this trip and she mentioned she would like to also road trip someday but drive west.\u00a0 Do it!!!!!\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_202804.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_202834.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_203442.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>Now in high spirits, I mentioned \u201cyou could even make it in the blog if you wanted to!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><p>Chad and Dejah both laughed loudly. Dejah said, \u201cI \u2018could\u2019?? There\u2019s a chance I \u2018could\u2019 be in the blog? Oh, I \u2018could\u2019 make the cut!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Bashfully, I realized how it came out, and apologized. Lol there isn\u2019t a screening process for anyone\nto be in the blog haha and we laughed some more. Dinner was off to a hilarious\nstart.</p>\n\n<p>HUNGRY, we ordered a MASSIVE Cobb Salad and the large Ted\u2019s Burger\n(all recommended by Dejah and the salad was massive like she said) and cleaned\nour plates.

The order came back and\nthere were THREE warm pop tarts on the plate! \nWhat a surprise! Dejah, you\nsneaky and thoughtful human!

The box was packed full!\u00a0 Like, more than 8 +++ full. They are really good. REALLY. The strawberry and blueberry-cream cheese were my favorites. \u00a0Thanks again!</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190429_213531/\"><img src=\"/images/national-mall/20190429_213531.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p>We drove into Maryland to rest at a Cracker Barrel about 30\nminutes away and the to-go box was reduced to crumbs. The lot was quiet, no other cars were parked,\nand we fell asleep almost instantly. We\nbriefly noticed how quiet and still everything was outside. So peaceful after a long day walking through\nhistory. </p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 30: Holy mackerel, it\u2019s\nbeen 30 days on the road trip and we aren\u2019t even close to home! We are going to need a vacation from our\nvacation. We are finally in the depths\nof New England and are beginning our food quest.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/the-nations-front-lawn/20190430_081951-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption> <br>Morning! (Yes, we aren't pretty yet....just woke up) </figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>After walking around the National Mall yesterday, our legs were a\nlittle stiff and our bodies didn\u2019t want to get going. We hung out in the car for a bit to wake up\nand planned our next moves (all-day parking garage and which museums to see).</p>\n\n<h2>Tips for Visiting D.C. National Mall</h2>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Walking:</strong> Plan to walk\nA LOT. Wear supportive shoes (no\nsandals, open toed, etc.) because you can easily put on 10 miles (minimum).</li><li><strong>Water:</strong> Drink a lot\nof water BEFORE you leave the parking garage to prevent having to buy\nwater/bring it with you. There are\nrestrooms in all the museums. </li><li><strong>Parking\nGarage:</strong> Find\nan ALL DAY parking garage close to where you want to go. (We parked in the L\u2019Enfant\nPlaza parking garage for $23 \u2013 found on a forum from a local).</li><li><strong>Free Museums:</strong> Check out\nwebsites and articles to learn about the free museums available. </li><li><strong>Public Transportation:</strong> There are Hop-On-Hop-Off\nbuses for a $1 each ride to tour around the monuments, take you to museums,\netc. Taxi cabs and peddle carts are\neverywhere and there are scooters/bikes to rent as well. Plenty of options to move! There are also trains (above and underground)\nthat could help too.</li><li><strong>Friendly\nAttitudes:</strong> If\nyou are \u2018Minnesota/Northerner Nice\u2019 to the staff working the museums and ask\nthem about their favorite piece/artwork/exhibit, they may share with you inside\nsecrets about hidden places to see, eat, go, experience, etc. </li></ul>\n\n<h2>Morning Routines</h2>\n\n<p>To get the D.C. exploration started, we parked in the L\u2019Enfant\nPlaza parking garage and Chad was able to chat with the parking garage attendant\nto make sure our car wasn\u2019t going to get towed (they parked us in assigned\nparking). The guy was really cheery and\nshared a handshake combination with Chad. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/the-nations-front-lawn/20190430_101112.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/the-nations-front-lawn/20190430_102623.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>and headed to a Starbucks located in the basement plaza. It was about 9 a.m. and the foot traffic of\nbusiness people was thick. There were only\nthree places to sit in the Starbuck\u2019s, otherwise the space was saved for lines\nof people. Chad caught up with some friends back home and went outside to chat\nwhile I blogged.</p>\n\n<p>Chad and I talked later about how the attitudes of the people\nworking in the store were short, non-conversational, abrupt and lacked any kind\nof cheery emotions. So, we might be\ngetting closer to the New Yorker style of conversating??? Minnesota Nice rejected lol. </p>\n\n<h2>Pre-Museum Walk</h2>\n\n<p>Destined towards the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural\nHistory, we marched along and made our way through the concrete jungle. It was a nice walk and we made it inside the\nfront doors of the museum. Security\n(almost like the airport) checked bags and had us put our spare pocket items\ninto buckets.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/the-nations-front-lawn/20190430_123242-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/the-nations-front-lawn/20190430_123415.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/the-nations-front-lawn/20190430_123748.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad always carries a flashlight and pocket knife with him, and\nsecurity didn\u2019t like the wee pocket knife. \nOptions: either throw it away or go put it in the car. Back to the car we went. Then back towards\nthe museum. (That\u2019s a little over 3\nmiles right there and we haven\u2019t even seen anything yet!). </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/the-nations-front-lawn/20190430_133034.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/the-nations-front-lawn/20190430_133455.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/the-nations-front-lawn/20190430_133958.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>A little flustered from the transaction, we ran into the same\nparking attendant and told him our story. \nBummed for us, he shared some places to see and do (locally and in New\nYork). Thanks, Mister! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/the-nations-front-lawn/20190430_134122.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\"

Lisa).\u00a0 We happened to have the only Irish-accent-speaking waiter in the whole joint and the food was super filling.\u00a0 We really liked the flavors and the poutine was great (Chad\u2019s had better at the Lowery in Uptown, Minneapolis).</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190430_173429/\"><img src=\"/images/the-nations-front-lawn/20190430_173429.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p>Food

    "content": "<p><strong>Second Stop: Pat\u2019s\nPhilly Cheese Steak Sandwich</strong></p>\n\n<p>Apparently, the first Philly cheese steak sandwich was made (invented and originated) at <a href=\"https://www.patskingofsteaks.com/\">Pat\u2019s King of Steaks</a>. Family owned and operated since 1930, they compete against across the street rebel <a href=\"https://www.genosteaks.com/\">Geno\u2019s Steaks</a> (1966). Use your best judgement and try a sandwich from any local restaurant. We were told by a community assistant (like community trust officers, but not officers) to avoid the food stand versions because they aren\u2019t as awesome. \u201cYou can\u2019t really go wrong,\u201d according to the lady we spoke to. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/philly-part-2/20190501_134702-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/philly-part-2/20190501_134958.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/philly-part-2/20190501_135121.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/philly-part-2/20190501_135617.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/philly-part-2/20190501_135730.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>At the end of the strip of stores, resided Pat\u2019s on the corner\n(literally, the corner lot. Special\nAssessments must be real expensive with 3 streets boarding the property!). We ordered the cheese Philly, \u2018wit onions\u2019\nand \u2018wit out\u2019 cheese wiz (sub for provolone instead). The order was up in less than 30 seconds and\nwe sat outside to eat it. It was just\nlike a regular sandwich and didn\u2019t blow either of our minds. Aw man\u2026.they got us good. Kinda a bust.</p>\n\n</div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We were going to try the competing Geno\u2019s, but decided that we\ncould find another yummy. We can make\nthese at home no problem.</p>\n\n<h2>Recovery Drink & Local Talk</h2>\n\n<p>Walking back towards the car, I saw the largest mocha coffee pot\nEVER! To the point where I thought it\nwould be a great idea to go inside and ask the \u2018nicer\u2019 looking coffee barista\nwhere the best food is located. We\nordered a coffee and the guy behind the counter shared that there isn\u2019t really\nany good food in Philly, except for the Mexican food. Lol. What??</p>\n\n<p>He said that there is a restaurant that is only open 3 days a week\nand has the BEST homemade corn tortillas with their 3-day slow roasted meat,\nall made into mouth-watering tacos in the owner\u2019s personally-made clay\noven. I guess we will have to come\nback?!</p>\n\n<p>Taking our coffee on a stroll, we dodged across a street that had\na car looking like it was going to run the stop sign. I had to hop/bound the remaining way to clear\nthe vehicle. I happened to spill some coffee on my tennis shoe during the process.</p>\n\n<p>Chad, oh clever Chad, mentioned, \u201cdon\u2019t worry about that stain on\nyour shoe, Katie. You only have to worry\nabout keeping me happy!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\ude0a To that, I responded, \u201cannnnnd to write down what we do each\nday! Your happiness and the blog are\nvery important.\u201d</p>\n\n<h2>Walk Around the City Center</h2>\n\n<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent walking around the new and old\nbuildings, checking out City Hall and investigating the entrance to a subway\nsystem. I have never seen one in person\nand I wanted to check it out.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cKatie, don\u2019t your feet hurt? \u2026 Yeah, we should start heading back to the car\u2026.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Not a fat chance! We walked\ndown the steps into the subway entrance and back through and up to the other\nside from where we came from. I should\nhave guessed that I would have to purchase a ticket before I could see the\ntrains\u2026. Maybe in New York I can see a subway!</p>\n\n<p>Oh! I also was able to try\na Philly-style pretzel that is box shaped for $.85 from the Pretzel Factory!</p>\n\n<h2>National Constitution Center</h2>\n\n<p>The last item for the day in Philly was to buzz through the National Constitution Center because Chad remembered seeing kidney stones on display when he was there last time. Without having to go through the ticketed part of the museum, we ducked into a little section of artifacts. </p>\n\n<p>No more than a minute inside this little room, a man approached us\nand I thought he was going to kick us out for not having a ticket for this\nexhibit. In fact, he wanted to share\nwith us about a new exhibit they are opening up on May 9 to explain the different\nAmendments for the United States. Sadly,\nwe were only planning on being in Philly for the day and he found this\ndisheartening. So, he offered to take us\non a private behind-the-scenes tour of the exhibit while it was still being\nworked on!</p>\n\n<p>But first, the duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron\nBurr. The guy, later discovered to be\ncalled NAME HERE, explained in detail the famous duel and how crazy of a time\nit was back then to have major dueling laws changed as well as how to properly review\ncourt cases with the new proceedings. </p>\n\n<p>NAME HERE then lapsed into discussion on artifacts of quill pens,\nnotes, paper, stop watches, and personal notes that have been preserved to this\nday. His passion for history is\nabsolutely contagious. Chad and I hung\non his every word and asked questions often.</p>\n\n<p>He then took us into the secret exhibit and there we saw the crew\nstill working on the finishing touches of the permanent display. They were even still placing artifacts into\ntheir cases and finalizing the graphics on the walls! (an old ink quill and pot\nused by former slave Frederick Douglass used to write a letter his previous\nmaster rolled by us on a cart and was installed into its exhibit right in front\nof us.)</p>\n\n<p>We talked about the history of the amendments, especially the 14<sup>th</sup>,\nto describe how without the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment, none of the previous\namendments really had any power. He then\nexplained that he spent 10 years as a lawyer studying legislative work and had\npracticed in Minnesota and Chicago. Now currently working with his favorite law\nprofessor, who happens to run the National Constitution Center, he is basically\n#2 and helps facilitate the exhibits and events. He loveds the \u2018nerdy\u2019 details of history and\nsharing it with others.</p>\n\n<p>We spent over an hour and half with him going over the history of\nthe exhibit and eventually parted ways. \nThank you so much for your history lesson, the special guided tour and\nyour tie! Wow. We live in a country with so much new, rich\nhistory. </p>\n\n<p>Car packed and ready, we hit the road out to New Jersey! </p>\n\n<h2>Chester, New Jersey</h2>\n\n<p>In the middle of New Jersey somewhere, we pulled off into a little\ntown called Chester because of the old houses-turned-restaurants. The fog was coming in and it seemed like the\nright mood for ice cream. \ud83d\ude0a But first, an Italian shop. \nWe tried their Eggplant Supreme (mozzarella cheese, basil, balsamic vinegar\non toasted bread) and their Mouth of Fire (spicy capicola, spicy sopressata,\nhot peppers, lettuce, tomato, oil and vinegar on regular bread). The eggplant sandwich was REALLY yummy!</p>\n\n<p>Down the street was the ice cream parlor and we tried their banana\nsplit with their homemade ice cream. \nThree flavors included pistachio, Oreo mint and caramel vanilla with\nsprinkled oreos and hot caramel on top. \nAlso, quite delicious.</p>\n\n<p>I ended the night with a stomach ache\u2026..(I should have known\nbetter, I always get sick with sugar\u2026.) and Chad said he feels better when he\nhas a salad. He can handle these foods\nbetter than I can. </p>\n\n<h2>Home Sweet Cracker Barrel</h2>\n\n<p>Only an hour out of Manhattan, New York, we situated ourselves\npretty good to make it into the city in the morning to then start our\nadventures in the Big Apple. Chad recommended\nknocking out the blog for today to make sure we have enough time for adventures\nin New York tomorrow. What a late\nnight! It\u2019s slightly raining out, Chad\u2019s\nfeet STINK from his hiking boots and has taken precautions to relieve the car\nof the stench (isopropyl alcohol spray/drenched boots now residing in the\ntrunk). Rest well! Stink less! </p>\n\n<p><!--EndFragment--><br>\n<br>\n</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 32: The Big Apple means\nbagels! Today was a day I have been looking forward to the entire road trip\nbecause I get to try New York\u2019s bagels. \nNot just any bagel - a bagel made from an old, established grocery store\nstarted back in the early 1900s with special techniques to make them\nrecognizable as \u2018New York Bagels\u2019.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/bagels/\"><img src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/bagels.jpg\" alt=\"Internet bagel portrait \" /></a>\n\n<p>It sounds like a lot of hokey-pokey marketing, and it is, but\nthere is a larger story behind the magic of the New York Bagel. I found an article detailing the history of crafting\nthe bagels in the early 1890s in dark, hot kitchens underneath the bakery with\nboiling water, extreme temperatures (sweating profusely, unsanitary, filthy\nclothing) and a lot of physical labor to work the tough dough. </p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/bagel-shop-1900s/\"><img src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/bagel-shop-1900s.jpg\" alt=\"Internet old bakery image\" /></a></figure>\n\n<p>Bagels became so popular in the New York area, that one of the fiercest unions of the time was launched in the 1950s, Bagel Bakers Local 338 (there were other unions too, but not like this one). </p>\n\n<p>Without machinery to undercut them, bagel bakers were able to command high salaries and if demands weren\u2019t met with contracted grocery stores (they only sold to stores, not directly to the public) they would go on strike. Yes, they had \u2018bagel famines\u2019! </p>\n\n<p>Seriously, <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/bagel-union-strikes-new-york-city\">read about the forgotten history of bagels in New York</a>. It is absolutely fascinating.</p>\n\n<h2>Wake Up Call</h2>\n\n<p>Ok, enough about bagels\u2026for now \ud83d\ude09 Chad and I\nparked about an hour out of Manhattan at Cracker Barrel for the night. I woke to see a cop car driving by our car making\nits rounds around the restaurant, hotel, and small strip mall. I didn\u2019t know that at the time and I thought\nthey were going to come for a visit.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190502_091230_001/\"><img src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_091230_001.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p>I woke Chad, we cleaned the car and put the sleeping materials away, (rubbed the lines off our faces from the sleeping masks lol) and tried to look awake. Alright, alright, we will get going to New York. Thanks for the early-ish wake up call (7:30 a.m.).</p>\n\n<h2>New Jersey Home Base</h2>\n\n<p>The night before, I researched places to see in Manhattan while Chad\nreviewed the logistics of parking and subway routes. </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>On the way to the parking garage, I mentioned, \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be awful if it was closed by the time we got there?\u201d I was referring to the bagel place I had secured (bagel brain over here!). </p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote><p>Having not been in my head, Chad responded, \u201cNew York? Yes, it would be bad if ALL of New York was closed!\u201d </p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Ah, the magic of misinterpretations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Parking: Town Square Garage, New Jersey - $25 all day parking</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Subway Train: PATH </strong></p>\n\n<p>I thought I could sneak the blog out in the morning (after having\ntried to upload pics to the website with phone hotspot \u2013 so slow) and had\nattempted to use a Starbucks after parking to get the blog out. Also, terribly slow uploading speeds. Until later, I guess. But, it was a great office view of the New\nYork skyline.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_092542.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_094453.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_094459.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>First Ride on the Subway</h2>\n\n<p>EEEEEEE, my first underground train! What a smell! But, first the ticketing\nprocess. Chad tried to ask one of the\nworking guys collecting cash from machines for the best way for us to pay for\ntravel (do we get a refillable card, a ticket etc.) and the guy abruptly said,\n\u201cnope\u201d and wanted to return to work. \nChad burst out a hardy laugh and complimented him on his honesty; that\nmade him smile. He then helped us learn how\nto use the machines, walk through the turn-style ticket booths and how to board\nthe correct train(s). Smiling, he wished\nus well and we ventured forth!</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/SmgbBTgc\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>What a stench! Oil, metal,\nstale air, humans, garbage, and who knows what wafted in the air. I have now been welcomed into the city\nlol. The trains whizzed by and I was\namazed at how large the terminals were underground. When we did board, we had to cram in\n(oooooooo sardines!! I am a sardine now!) and we rode the \u2018F\u2019 train under the\nwater over to Manhattan.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_095121.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_100215.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_100856.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_101550.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We made our first transfer, popped above ground and starred at the\nbuildings briefly before finding our next staircase down into the dungeons of\nManhattan. Unfortunately, we missed our\nconnecting train because we didn\u2019t take their \u20181-minute\u2019 boarding time\nseriously enough haha. </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/1ZXSfiUR\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>Now, all I need is a Subway sandwich and to eat it on the subway!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_102635.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_102647.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_102919.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_103535.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Looking up inside the tunnel, I pointed to a security camera we\nwere standing directly under (less than a foot from Chad\u2019s head).</p>\n\n<blockquote><p> \u201cWe are under the Manhattan mistletoe!\u201d exclaimed Chad.</p></blockquote>\n\n<h2>First Stop is Bagels, Duh</h2>\n\n<p>Surfacing from the subway system into clean (well, I guess cleanish) air, we walked the rest of the way to the bagel grocery store called <a href=\"https://www.russanddaughters.com/\">Russ & Daughters</a> (original location, lower Manhattan). There was a long line inside, so we took a number and finally ordered. There were all kinds of people in the store and we chatted with the Asian clerk making our meal. He said this was a slow time and that usually it is a 2-hour wait out the door for bagels. We were defiantly in the right place!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_105237.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_105240.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_105246.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_105713.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_105725.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Eating, tasting, nibbling and enjoying the treats took place on a\nbench right outside the store.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#1: Norwegian Lox, sesame seed bagel, regular cream cheese spread, tomato slice, red onion slices, capers $14</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>#2: Everything bagel, lox cream cheese spread $6</strong></p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_110155.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_110414.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_110530.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_110436.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Katie\u2019s Review - Crunching on the outside, chewy dough on the\ninside. Tough-ish to rip apart for each\nbite (that\u2019s a good thing) and the ingredients complimented each other\nwell. The lox spread included other\nspices in the mix with the lox and cream cheese (that was a surprise!).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_111038.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_111516.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_111715.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>I would say the bagels I ate today are very similar to the bagels I LOVE in Fargo. Yes, Fargo does have an excellent Jewish deli, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BernBaums/\">BernBaum\u2019s</a>, and their bagels (secret recipe handed down from within their family) are stellar. I\u2019ve been spoiled with great bagels in Fargo and the New York bagels feel like home rather than a mind-blowing experience. That\u2019s when you know you have a good bagel!! Both still different tasting/feeling, ever so slightly, but quite good.</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/j2XMisvl\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/best-bagel-in-manhattan/20190502_111732.jpg\" /><p>Take a little drive and head over to BernBaum\u2019s in Fargo, now at their new location on Broadway, for an ever-changing foodie experience. Ah, New York\u2026.yes\u2026. I would also recommend Russ & Daughters haha. </p>\n\n<p>Chad also like the bagels, but he isn't as enthused as I am about the experience. He was just floored as to how much gourmet sandwich bagels cost!</p>\n\n<p>This post is getting long! \nUntil next time!</p>\n\n<p>Coming Soon - <a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/2019/05/03/sunny-manhattan/\">Part 2: Day 32 in Manhattan</a></p>",

Thank\nyou!!!</p>\n\n<p>Now situated on the correct train heading north, we were\nentertained with loud rap music blaring from a passenger. Some older ladies were appalled and said to\nturn it down. He then started yelling about racism and everyone on the car\nfound other things to do to avoid any confrontation in the enclosed space. The guy soon left and the man sitting next to\nus said that there is always some form of entertainment on the trains, whether\nwanted or not! </p>\n\n<h4>Middle of Manhattan Sights Seen</h4>\n\n<ul><li>Grand Central Station</li><li>Chrysler Building</li><li>Times Square </li><li>Radio City Music Hall</li><li>Rockefeller Center \u2013 Jimmy Fallon and the Tonight\u2019s Show!</li><li>Trump Tower</li><li>South end of Central Park </li><li>Columbus Circle</li><li><a href=\"https://www.luigispizzanyc.com/restaurants/ny/new-york/10019/luigi-s-gourmet-pizza/menu\">Luigi\u2019s Gourmet Pizza</a> \u2013 First New York slice of pizza for Katie, repeat offender Chad had 4 slices.

    "content": "<p>Day 33: Escaping the big Manhattan, New York congested mess, we made\nit to the countryside in Massachusetts. \nNext on the list was Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Cape Cod.</p>\n\n<p>We woke at Cracker Barrel about two hours away from our ferry port\nat Woods Hole late (9 a.m.), and we started off the morning with pit stop at a\nfancy-looking local grocery store. The\ninside decor was designed after their historic town buildings and architecture.\nFrom the deli, we tried their eggplant lasagna ($10???? For a slice) and a \u00bc lb\nof chicken & cranberry salad ($2). We\nwere bummed that the lasagna cost what it did and we still had to heat it\nup! Should have just gone to a restaurant!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_093949.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_095349.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_095451.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Next stop, a good drive. \nSkipping the blogging in the morning, Chad beelined it to the landing to\ncatch to earliest ferry to Marth\u2019s Vineyard. </p>\n\n<p>I researched how to use the ferry system while we passed through\nsmall towns, greenery (newly budding leaves and flowers, it\u2019s cold here! In the\n50s) and a lot of trees. We went over a massive bridge that was reduced to one\nlane because of construction and when we were on the other side, the line of cars\nto get over the ONLY bridge (in that area) was backed up at least 5 miles. For a small town, that\u2019s kind of a big deal.</p>\n\n<h2>Catch the Ferry!</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.steamshipauthority.com/\">Steamship Authority website was helpful</a> and we parked at a designated ferry lot in Woods Hole ($13 for the day) and they shuttled us (free) to the terminal where we bought tickets as walk-on passengers ($17 per person).\u00a0 If we wanted to bring the car, we would\u2019ve had to make a reservation and the earliest we could get it across was at 7 p.m. (grand total of $162.00).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_114712.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_115706.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_115839.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_120052.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_120803.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We bought tickets at 11:55 a.m. and the ferry left at noon. Close call! Otherwise, we would have had to\nwait an hour for the next one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendation: </strong>Just get a passenger ticket, leave the car, and ride the ferry (furry friends welcome).\u00a0 Then, use the bus system on Martha\u2019s Vineyard Island ($8 per person for an all-day fare) to see everything.\u00a0 You can rent bikes and cars, but it seemed easier to ride the bus around.</p>\n\n<h2>Martha\u2019s Vineyard</h2>\n\n<p>Chad took at 45 minute nap on the first ferry ride. He was so out! The ferry had puppies, people, cars, trucks\nand a snack bar (didn\u2019t try it this time). \nWhile Chad was sleeping, I saw a seal pop its head out splash\naround! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_123212.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_123221.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_124257.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We walked off the ferry onto a chilly island (we wore our\nPatagonia Nano Hoodies \u2013 bur!) and figured out the bus system (kinda). There\nwas a bus waiting, so we just hopped on it to stay warm and to see a little\nloop around the neighborhood. The bus\ndriver was kind enough to let me hop out at the tip of the route so I could get\na picture of a \u2018majestic\u2019 light house. \nHe laughed and said this specific light house was a common misconception\n(it\u2019s a little house haha). </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_130850.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_1311410.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>I asked about the grey shingles on the side of the homes and he told\nus the cedar siding is great for this area because of the salty air (it doesn\u2019t\nerode as fast as other siding). With the\ngrey home, grey sky and no greenery on the trees yet, the whole place seemed really\ndepressing. It\u2019s also the off-season for tourism, so a lot of the shops are\nclosed and there aren\u2019t very many people coming/going. </p>\n\n<h2>Map Trouble</h2>\n\n<p>After having a hard time figuring out the bus schedule map, I\nasked the driver how to transfer to the next town. He told me to flip the map over and all of the\ntimes lined up. Ooops. I guess we were looking at the winter\nschedule and now that May is here, the other side of the map is what we needed.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_155820.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The rest of the day was filled with bus riding and driving through really remote areas.\u00a0 The island had a lot of trees, old old homes and unique gingerbread-looking homes.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_134734.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_134833.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_134836.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_135023.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_141108-1.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_141117.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>This place is highly regarded for vacation escapes and I would assume that is because you can rent out a cottage or B&B space near the ocean (so dreamy!).\u00a0 But right now, it just looks like a palate of grey colors (ocean water included) and we don\u2019t know what you would do for entertainment!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_142517.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_142632.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_143800.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_143812.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Right now in May, it is a chilly beach town environment and there wasn\u2019t that much to do or see.\u00a0 There were little bits of history everywhere (every town ever has history lol) and you can go on bike trails, hiking and walking, beaching, probably go on the ocean, eat, sleep, and read on the porch.\u00a0 It would a nice place for actually resting\u2026..but we are on a vacation to SEE things and DO things \ud83d\ude0a </p>\n\n<h2>Waiting for the Ferry</h2>\n\n<p>We waited to catch the 5 p.m. ferry and we just HAD to kill some time walking around the little downtown.\u00a0 This then lead to trying some homemade ice cream.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_1559350.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_155959.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_160518.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_160521.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>You could tell it was homemade because you could see the mixers in the back and smell the milk (like you stuck your head in the milk tank at a dairy barn \u2013 yep, that\u2019s the smell of milk!).\u00a0 We tried their caramel pecan, Oreo, mint, and black cherry.\u00a0 Oh. the black cherry was excellent.\u00a0 The others were also very good (Oreo mint on accident!).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_161224.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_161443_001.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_161534.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_161829.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/4qu5chzH\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Back to the Car</h2>\n\n<p>Once on the ferry, I researched placed to have dinner and Chad\nfell asleep again. He was out cold again\nand this time, he happened to forget to close his eyes haha. Retracing our steps, we packed onto a shuttle\nbus (we had to stand like the subway) and returned to the car. It just started to sprinkle rain and the day became\neven gloomier. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_161829-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_162916.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_162950.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_162954.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_171852.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Seafood Pronunciation</h2>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://www.paulspizzacapecod.com/index.php\">Paul\u2019s Pizza & Seafood</a> (one of the only ones that doesn\u2019t cost $35+ for one plate of food) and it was a hidden gem.\u00a0 Tucked away in a little secluded drive, the parking lot was packed with people.\u00a0 We took the time to catch up with Chad\u2019s grandparents and sounds like Minnesota is still chilly.\u00a0 Cliff said we will most likely be home by the 4<sup>th</sup> of July (we gasped, that\u2019s a really LONG trip) and Phyllis said that I might need another purple heart for some of the adventures we have been on (specifically the van ride up the mountain for ziplining!). </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_184840.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_185523.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_185823.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_190431.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_191207.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_193213.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_193238.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_193244.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>For dinner, we tired their New England Clam Chowder (chow-der),\nscallops (skaaal-ups) and a Quahog (ko-hog). \nThe soup was creamy and yummy. Chad liked the scallops a lot (maybe a pass\nfor me) and the quahog was yummy. It was\nlike stuffing made with the clam meat, breading, peppers, spices, etc. You can\nspritz lemon and pour butter over the stuffing or dip it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/mbJZ0STP\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>They also had personal-sized pizzas that looked really good, but\nwe came to try the seafood. I guess they\nmake over 80,000 pizzas in a year, so they are pretty popular! </p>\n\n<h2>Rest is the Best</h2>\n\n<p>Finding a local McDs, we pulled in for me to upload content about\nNew York. So far, Mcdonald\u2019s has had the\nFASTEST upload speeds out of all of the places we have been to (I would very\nmuch like another bagel right now).</p>\n\n<p>Only a short drive up the road was our sleeping destination:\nWalmart. But, it was a nice Walmart\nbecause all of the buildings in Falmouth are constructed to look like old\nbuildings with a particular theme. So,\nthis building looked bright, shiny and welcoming with trees in the parking\nlot. There was also another car camper\nand a legit camper, so we hung out with those guys for the night.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_223819.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_223832.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/marthas-vineyard/20190503_223852.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>It started to rain right as we were falling asleep and the ting of\nthe drops hitting the roof lulled us to sleep. \nIt was chilly outside, but nice and warm in our metal mobile tent.</p>\n\n<p><em>Tomorrow, maybe a shower at the National Seashore??\u00a0 </em></p>",

The ocean was noisy, there were\nonly two other people on the beach that we could see and the sky was\ncloudy. Ugh, the setting for a horror movie\nis almost perfect. We then saw a warning\nsign about shark attacks\u2026 it\u2019s official. \nIt\u2019s JAWS! (fun fact: a lot of\nthe Jaws movie was filmed at Marth\u2019s Vineyard).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_090917.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_092433.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_092451.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We weren\u2019t really dirty or stinky enough to really need a shower, but\nit was tempting to know how cold the water was. \nThe video explains my experience. </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/1M9mzVBK\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>Chad waded in dunked under right away. According to their website,\nthe water temp was 46 degrees. We stayed\ntogether in the shallow water and didn\u2019t go out very far to avoid potential\nshark issues and didn\u2019t last very long. \nChad went in twice and I tried three times, but it was way too\ncold. My legs turned blotchy purple and\nred! My feet were numb and it took 20\nminutes in the car blasting heat for feeling to return to my heels lol. It was so cold!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_092535.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_092653.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_092707.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_092724.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_092755.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/NhOB27pY\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_095503.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_095524.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_100626.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_111402.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_095436-1.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Plymouth Rock</h2>\n\n<p>After freezing our buns in the water, we <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/the-real-story-behind-plymouth-rock\">drove to Plymouth to see the pilgrims\u2019 special rock</a>.\u00a0 Their pet rock is well tamed and has it\u2019s own cage next to the water.\u00a0 It sat nicely for all of our pictures and even let me take a selfie with it.

Just a couple of teenagers who were showing off their skills on a Saturday! We ate Chad\u2019s surprise meal in the car (a Reuben!) before we left.\u00a0 Less than an hour in Plymouth \ud83d\ude0a </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_115848.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_115912.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_115920.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_115933.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Art Museum</h2>\n\n<p>We didn\u2019t think that Boston would be as busy as New Yok, but it\nwas! There were cars everywhere, horns\nhonking, barely any on-street metered parking and tons of people walking\naround. Uff-dah, what a misconception.</p>\n\n<p>First stop, a free museum tour at the <a href=\"https://www.mfa.org/\">Museum of Fine Arts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gardnermuseum.org/\">Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum</a>.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p><strong>Parking:\nMuseum of Fine Arts Parking Garage - $20 for the day</strong></p>\n\n<p>The reason we were hitting the museums was because admission was\nfree! If you are a Bank of America\ncardholder, you can visit select museums around the U.S. on the first weekend\nof the month. So, these two were free\nfor both of us!</p>\n\n<p>The line was OUT THE DOOR and down the street for the Isabella\nStewart Gardner Museum. Nope. Skipped it.</p>\n\n<p>Next! The line for the Art Museum was moving pretty quick so we\ndecided to give it a shot. We didn\u2019t even make it through the entire\nmuseum! There were at least three buildings\nattached by skyways and it had three floors. Chad and I loved seeing the old\ninstruments (even the lute and old clarinet!) and the paintings. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_134651.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_134722.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_134927.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_135203.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_135427.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_140530.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_140604.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_140655.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_140832.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_140855.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_141024.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_141301.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_141624.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_141649.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_141731.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_141838.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_142226.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_142434.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_143437.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_143510.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_143524.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_143622.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_143714.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_143900.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_143946.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_144045.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_144113.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_144153.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_144244.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_144346.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_144823.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_150735.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We would recommend spending the day here!

It\u2019s basically New York haha.</p>\n\n<h2>#2 Pie Try & Cannoli Pastries </h2>\n\n<p>Moving the car down into the North End, we were transported back\nin time to really old brick buildings, skinny streets and cobble stone. People are\neverywhere! There are LINES out the\ndoors of the pastry places I wanted to go. </p>\n\n<p>There is NO street parking (residential only) and we had to duck\ninto a parking garage. But, the garage\nwe went into lifts cars onto ramps and stacks them on shelves! We didn\u2019t want any part of that not knowing\nhow long we were going to be there. We\nquickly backed up and found a new place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Parking:\nLewis Wharf Parking Lot - $23 for the day</strong></p>\n\n<p>We walked by Paul Revere\u2019s House!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_1619090.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_161916.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>I waited in line at <a href=\"https://www.mikespastry.com/\">Mike\u2019s Pastry</a> while Chad ran to an ATM for cash (cash only apparently).\u00a0 The line moved pretty fast (50+ people out the door) and we ordered a Boston Cream Pie, regular ricotta cannoli, pistachio cannoli and chocolate ricotta cannoli. The stern lady behind the counter forget the regular ricotta, which is fine because all I wanted to do was get out of there.\u00a0 $4 a cannoli and $6 for the pie. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_162539.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_162633.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_163347.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_163428.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We had a better cannoli in Philly! \nIt was a little disappointing, but the experience was out of this world.\n </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_163701.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_164003.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_164607.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Italian for Dinner</h2>\n\n<p>We tried a restaurant off the main strip called <a href=\"https://www.anticofornoboston.com/\">Antico Forno</a> (there\u2019s way too many people everywhere!).\u00a0 The restaurant was packed still, noisy and the TVs broadcasted the Derbie.

We walked\nabout .7 of a mile to the bridge where the tea party happened to take\nplace. I didn\u2019t want to get fined for \u2018littering\u2019\ntea into the harbor (plus, no need for caffeine at 7 p.m.!), so I dumped my imaginary\ntea into the harbor. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_180933.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_181224.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_180951.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Harvard</h2>\n\n<p>Chad and I were in the accelerated class and went to visit Harvard campus before we left town. Chad had thought Harvard was going to be in a more secluded space but it was jammed into the infrastructure and surrounded by people. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_191059.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_191151.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_191338.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_191340.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_1913440.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_191426.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Salem Witches \u2013 Check!</h2>\n\n<p>Deciding we would rather watch a documentary and binge on history videos about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_witch_trials\">Salem Witch Trials</a> when we get home, we drove the town at night to see the big-ish landmarks.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>I took a picture of where the trials were estimated to be held on\nProctor\u2019s Ledge near Gallows Hill Park. Chad\nspotted the Witch\u2019s House where it is said that a judge from the case actually\nate/slept. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_191536.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_195513.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_200030.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_200118.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_200407.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Then, we drove down their main strip of buildings to end up at the\nHoward Street Cemetery right at dusk. \nSpooky! </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThat was the essence of \u2018walk it with your eyes\u2019!\u00a0 We finished in less than 20 minutes!\u201d stated Chad.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>After a quick swing into the McDonald\u2019s parking lot for a blog\nupload, we set the GPS for the coastline of Maine. Finally, we are almost to the top! </p>\n\n<h2>Pit Stop for Sleep</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of making it to Maine, we reclined the seats for rest at the\nfirst New Hampshire Visitors Center. \nThere were at least 20+ car campers in the parking lot and that was\nenough proof for us to know that we would be alright. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/boston-tea-party/20190504_213844.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>It\u2019s actually chilly at night (low 40s) so I curl up in the down\nsleeping bag. Meanwhile, Chad has an old\ntwin comforter and another blanket (cotton kills!!) that doesn\u2019t hold as much\nheat. He is always burrowed in to stay\nwarm! </p>",

    ],

    "content": "<p>Day# 35: Onward to\nMaine! We are almost to our highway one-mile\nmarker destination at the very tip of Maine. \nOnly the coastline to go and we will have conquered the east coast trip!</p>\n\n<p>We woke at a New Hampshire Visitor\u2019s Center LATE in the\nmorning. We slept in unit 9:30 a.m.\n(super tired from our many days of constant go-go-go) and cleaned the inside of\nthe car. Happy car, happy chad! You must\nkeep your road trip chauffeur happy otherwise we won\u2019t get anywhere haha.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_113423.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_113530.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_113823.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Now destined to have a foodie day (we can finally have lobsters!),\nwe tried to get back on the highway to avoid tolls and started driving.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Mouth agape, Chad said, \u201cit want\u2019s us to get back onto the highway we were avoiding!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That\u2019s because there was a toll coming up! But, the liquor store parking lot didn\u2019t have\na second way out and we ended up paying the $2 toll. Lesson #756: \nsetting GPS to avoid tolls sometimes means going through tolls. Logical,\nright?</p>\n\n<p>The GPS stated, \u201cwelcome to Maine\u201d. Chad replied, \u201cwe \u2018Maine-d\u2019 it!\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The trees on either side of the highway resemble the ones back\nhome in Minnesota. It\u2019s like we never\nleft. Tall pine trees are back! </p>\n\n<h2>Lobster!!!!!</h2>\n\n<p>Without a real destination in mind, Chad mapped us to a little ocean\ntown named Ogunquit. I found a little lobster\nplace to eat at and we avoided the paid parking lots.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Parking: 3 hour free parking \u2013 Stearms Road</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Walking Trail: Marginal Way</strong></p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_115006.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_120145.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_120301.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_120336.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_120534.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_120537.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_121205.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_120611.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We walked around the rocky cliffs all the way to the little wharf. Barnacle Billy\u2019s happened to also be the\nplace where President Bush senior liked to eat lobster too. How fancy! </p>\n\n<p><strong>Food Order: 1.5 lbs of lobster ($30+) and one lobster roll sandwich ($18)</strong></p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_121740.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_121940.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_121955.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_123716.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_123802.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_124051.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_124335.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad and I agreed that the lobster was just like eating a VERY large version of the crayfish back in Louisiana. To be honesty, we weren\u2019t that thrilled and didn\u2019t understand the hype about why lobster is as big of a deal as it is. Well, lobster used to be considered poor man\u2019s food! <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/a-taste-of-lobster-history\">Check out the marking history of lobster and learn how it went from fertilizer to a delicacy.</a> </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_124339.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_125846.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190505_130512/\"><img src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_130512.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><figcaption>25 lb Lobster caught in 1958 at 516 ft</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Not that far down from the restaurant was another little place\ncalled Foot Bridge Lobster and they had a special for a free pound of lobster! If only we had walked further! I would still recommend making a little trip\nto the space. The best part was the\nnature walk around the cliff edges.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_130953.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_130820.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_1308450.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_130907.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Food Hoppin\u2019</h2>\n\n<p>Ready to try some more seafood, we continued driving while I\ncaught up on typing. </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Chad joked and said, \u201cnext time, I want a revenge trip. I write the blog and you drive!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I think someone got up on the wrong side of the bed today! Hmm\u2026.maybe he would be better at it than I\nam!

Chad want\u2019s to head back to Minnesota and\ncall in an order to his grandma for a massive plate of her mashed potatoes!

Stinky!! I think he said there are no more clean socks\nleft\u2026 ha ha \u2026. Time for a scrub in a sink! </p>\n\n<h2>Boondocks on Highway 1</h2>\n\n<p>We set the GPS towards Arcadioa National Park to rest at a WalMart\nfor the night and drove through some beautiful country. Hills tucked next to the cliffs, greenery,\npine trees and water everywhere. It looks\nlike we are driving up to the North Shore in MN. Welcome home!? </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_190306.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_191359.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_192339.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Driving for more than 3 hours, we transitioned from OLD small towns to the country side to places where we hoped the car didn\u2019t happen to break down within (more dueling banjos). </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_195849.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_200222.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_203904.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-lobster/20190505_205636.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We ended up in a little town called Ellsworth and stopped at a grocery store for a bathroom break. This also lead to trying a regular ricotta cannoli and their walnut caramel ice cream.</p>\n\n<p>For sleep, we parked and camped in the Wal-Mart parking lot and the night was pretty chilly. Pillow palace and blankets galore! Night Night.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 36: Finally, there was\na day on the trip that was a little more low key and less go-go-go \u201csee\neverything that you can\u201d. Our road trip\nwas (and still is) planned to see as much as we could in short amounts of\ntime. We have seen a lot and traveled over\n5,580 miles so far. Wowza. ANNDD we are only in the middle of\nMaine. We still have to get home!</p>\n\n<h2>A Date with Coffee</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Location: Ellsworth, Maine</strong></p>\n\n<p>To catch up on some work, we packed up from our sleeping space in Wal-Mart and drove to a local coffee shop called <a href=\"http://flexitcafe.com/\">Flexit Caf\u00e9</a>. We parked it for the entire morning (free).\u00a0 We tired their light roast twice, a quiche and some kind of egg pastry-pop-over-thing.\u00a0 It was a good creative session.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190506_090840/\"><img src=\"/images/maine-small-town/20190506_090840.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p>For a late afternoon lunch, we swung by the local grocery store\nand gathered ingredients for another round of massive salads. This time, Chad went for two cans of sardines\nand I stuck to one. After about 15\nminutes, our jaws were tired of chewing the veggies and it\u2019s basically a\nmarathon to finish the entire thing. </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\"It's tough work...\" says Chad as he chomped on his extra-topping salad.</p></blockquote>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/maine-small-town/20190506_164225.jpg\" /><h2>Movie Time</h2>\n\n<p>Now full and cleaned up, we decided the Acadia National Park could wait until tomorrow so we could have as much time as we needed since it was already 4:30 p.m.\u00a0 Pondering the idea of going to see a movie, we looked up some theaters in the area and watched a few trailers.\u00a0 45 minutes later, we arrived in a town called Bangor and bought tickets to <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2139881/\">Long Shot</a></em>.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5jiaHvx-kY\n</div></figure>\n\n<p>While walking into the movie theater, I dropped my phone pretty\ngood on the asphalt and cracked my screen protector in a few places. When we get home I will have to peel it off\nand check to see if the real screen is cracked underneath it. Bummer! \nBut, it has withstood tons of drops without screen damage, so I can\u2019t\ncomplain too much.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/maine-small-town/20190506_182901.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We laughed a lot and enjoyed the movie.\u00a0 It was a fun new story line and the jokes were awesome.\u00a0\u00a0 There were only about 6 other people in the whole theater (everyone was at Avengers Infinity War) and it had leather recliner seats. </p>\n\n<p>It was a good way to spend the evening and we drove home (home lol we went back to Wal-Mart) through the country side that looks just like driving to Bemidji or to the North Shore.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/maine-small-town/20190506_182912.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>Time for Bed</h2>\n\n<p>Maine is just like Minnesota, except there is a massive ocean and\nseafood available. The trees, weather,\ndirt and people are basically the same (everywhere we go there are friendly\nhumans!). </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/maine-small-town/20190506_175314.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We made camp for the second night in the SAME Wal-Mart parking\nlot. This is a big deal because we don\u2019t\nstay somewhere twice (usually). This time\nthere were two other RVs and a few sprinklings of car campers there with us.</p>\n\n<p>Routine down-pat, we were off to bed in no time. Our routines include:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Chad scrolling through the news feed while I pull out the sleeping\ngear (blankets + pillows) from the truck through the folding back seats. Pretty sneaky, huh?</li><li>Chad relays news while I prep my side and clear the back seat for\nChad\u2019s seat to recline.</li><li>We both floss and brush our teeth.</li><li>Chad gets his side ready while I cleanse with the spa experience only\nwet wipes can offer.</li><li>Chad then goes to the spa and sprays isopropyl alcohol on his\nboots/feet to reduce smells.</li><li>I can\u2019t forget my retainers (if I don\u2019t wear them a massive migraine\nhits!).</li><li>We both dawn our sleeping masks and fall asleep in our pillow palaces\n(Chad is now only using 1 and I have 4\u2026 I have more of the palace).</li></ul>\n\n<p>Night night!</p>",

For breakfast we had bananas, kefir and baby carrots. The park only 30-ish minutes away and we purchased a day pass (it comes with 7 days of free entry to the park).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_110444.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_110455.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_111028.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_111251.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_111310.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_111333.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Everything looked like we were driving through northern Minnesota\nwith the pine trees, rocks, trails and weather. \nThe ocean was a surprise through the trees and we remembered we were defiantly\nnot in Minnesota.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_111310-1.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_111321.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_111542.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Beehive</h2>\n\n<p>Our friend, John, recommended going on a hike at The Beehive. Alright,\nwhy not? It was only 520 feet and about 1.9 miles.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.mainetrailfinder.com/trails/trail/acadia-national-park-beehive-loop\">The Beehive</a> is an exposed, iron rung climb.

Chad did some research on a\nfew forums and I watched a video from a camper who did a walk-through of the\nbuilding to confirm the showers were accessible, clean to use and available to\nanyone (not just the campers). All was\nwell! We were going to have showers!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_135232.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_135626.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_135644.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_140258.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_1406260.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The place was clean, there were instructions everywhere, there was\na change machine to get quarters and the showers had individual rooms where the\nwater was coin operated. For $2, the\noccupant is given 4 minutes of hot water (10 gallons). </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_1440320.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Chad went first while I recovered from having the kefir and started\non the blog in the car. Chad walked out with\nhis Jesus hair down and blue jeans to wave me inside. HEEEELLLLLLO, Chad! I guess Chad\u2019s shower experience was a little\ntoo short and he had to re-up for a second 4-minute luxury. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_143644.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_143709.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_143722.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_143805.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_143817.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_150614.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Trying to outsmart the machine, he turned off the water after\ngetting drenched to soap up thinking it would pause the time. Nope! \nReady to rinse off and full of soap, time ran out and the water wouldn\u2019t\nturn on again. Oops. Round two went much better. Silly Chad.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_153622.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_153708.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Now with the understanding that I will be taking TWO showers, I\nnailed the shower experience and used my time wisely to make sure I didn\u2019t get\ncaught with suds without water to rinse.</p>\n\n<h2>Mountain Top </h2>\n\n<p>Newly clean peas, we climbed back into our dirty pod (car) to finish the rest of the park. It started to rain and we drove the to the top of Cadillac Mountain (1,530 ft). </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_155814.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_1558350.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_155857.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_155926.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_160346.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We climbed out of the car with our rain jackets, flip flops and pants rolled up to avoid splashes while making our way to the edge of the look out. The view was spectacular (even in the rain) and the wind was whipping us with the rain pellets. Time to go!</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_160111-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>Lobster: Round 2</h2>\n\n<p>We made it out of the park (with a happy Chad who applied RainX to\nthe windows that morning and it was working phenomenally) and backtracked towards\nEllsworth. Hankering to try another\nround of lobster, we pulled into one of the only open lobster restaurants on\nthe strip (our friend John mentioned there was a guy who sold lobster out of\nhis home, but it didn\u2019t look like his place was open :/ \u2026. Maybe next time!).</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_170421.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I went in to scout it out and went back to the car to get\nChad. I guess today was their first day\nopen for the season and we were in luck! \nFor diner we order their 1.25 lb lobster meal (X2) which came with two\nsides. I tried the coleslaw and Chad\ntried the potato salad; we both also had fries. \nThe lobster was better this time and we were much more thorough getting all\nthe meat out of the crevices. We even\nwere given bibs!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_164552.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_164600.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_165506.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_170113.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_170219.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The older ladies running the joint also owned it. They chatted with us for a bit and answered\nour questions about the temperament of Maine. \nWe mentioned the older barns on farms are attached to the house and\nasked why that is. Apparently, the snow\ngets so bad with the wind and cold temps that it makes it terribly impossible\nto go out to the barn quickly. So,\nfarmers just attach the barn to the farm house with a corridor for storage. Crazy!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_1750200.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_175030.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Laundry Time</h2>\n\n<p>It was time to do laundry. We\nhad stretched our articles of clothing out to their max capacity and today was\nthe day for a change. We shall be clean!</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Our first laundromat experience: the lady looked at us like \u201cumm\u2026you need me to show you how to do laundry???\u201d lol yes\u2026 how do you use the machines? Where do we get soap?</p></blockquote>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_182354.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/hot-showers-in-acadia-national-park/20190507_192932.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The lady working at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Eden-Laundry-964730556940437/\">Eden Laundry</a> was really nice and helped us set everything so we wouldn\u2019t ruin our clothes haha. While we waited for the clothing to finish, I typed in the car and Chad meditated to classical music. This was good for both of us because it was quiet, calm and were able to be in the moment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pro Tip #865:</strong> bring a bag or laundry basket with you when you move clothes from the washer to the dryer across the room. We forgot to bring in the bag and we had to move our clothes VERY carefully out to avoid dropping any on the floor (because it\u2019s a front-loading washer. One wrong move and the socks are going to escape!).</p>\n\n<p>Washed, dried and folded, we are now officially 75 % clean. We will have to clean the car tomorrow in\norder for everything to be alright again haha. \nBeing clean does make a different in moods and your environment does\nmatter.</p>\n\n<h2>Dusk</h2>\n\n<p>The remainder of the evening was spent attached to the McDonald\u2019s\nWiFi while parked in their lot to upload the blog and connect with the online\nworld for a bit. There is terrible cell\nservice for us out here in Maine (I have zippo and Chad sometimes has bars \u2013\nboth have Sprint).</p>\n\n<p>Chad\u2019s toes already smell and we haven\u2019t even done anything\nyet! We just cleaned! Oh well. \nWe headed back to Wal-Mart to stay for an unspeakable third night in a\nrow!!!! Record breaking! Night Night.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 38: \u00a0Why not go as far east as possible on the \u2018East Coast\u2019 trip?\u00a0 Hello, Canada!\u00a0 We are coming for you!\u00a0 As soon as we get to Nova Scotia, we can start heading back towards MN through the Great Lakes highways (and hit the large Canadian cities). </p>\n\n<p>We won't be taking the ferry to Newfoundland ($1,000+ round trip for the ride), so we will be coming back to Minnesota now! This is as far as we go east. The turning point. </p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_115836.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Somewhere in Canada</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2>8+ Hours of Driving</h2>\n\n<ul><li>Started: Ellsworth, Maine</li><li>Traveled U.S. Highway 1 </li><li>Crossed the Border near Upper Mills (just south) into Canada</li><li>Welcome to New Brunswick!</li><li>Traveled Canada Highway 1 </li><li>Hit Saint John (pee break!)</li><li>Drove, drove, drove</li><li>Welcome to Nava Scotia!</li><li>Ended: Halifax, Nova Scotia</li></ul>\n\n<p>Canada is basically like driving through a National Park. It\u2019s green with pine trees (cold now, so\nthere aren\u2019t any other leaves), rocky with mountain-like hills everywhere and\nmassive boulders. The glaciers really\ndropped a lot of rocks here because the farm fields are just piled high with\nHUGE rocks. A little Bobcat isn\u2019t going\nto move these monsters. Good luck\nplowing! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_115852.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_115927.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We drove through some back roads to avoid tolls and we noticed their\ngarbage cans were wooden cylinders. Chad\nresearched a little and found an article about the proper way to dispose of garbage\nwhile living in rural areas because of black bears. No meat scraps can go into the garbage until\nthe day of pick-up (store everything in your freezer until then!), make sure\nyou hide the wooden cylinder garbage can in a secure storage shed and make sure\nto scrub off your grill when you bbq! </p>\n\n<h2>Driving Driving</h2>\n\n<p>Chad and I switched driving part way through the day and it felt good to drive again.\u00a0 I was able to drive through some really rural, back highways with really beautiful mountain/hills.\u00a0 In the winter, it looks like the roads are shut down and the snowmobiles take over the road (no ditch riding here!\u00a0 What a privilege).\u00a0 I guess the snow gets pretty deep around here??\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>We stopped at a bookstore! (Didn't see anything of interest this time!)</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_122941.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_131731.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_132035.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_132834.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_135140.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_135707.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_140130.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Costco</h2>\n\n<p>First stop when we got to Halifax was to fuel up at Costco. We arrived and discovered they don\u2019t have fuel\nat this location (no worries, there is a gas station around the corner), so we\nwent in to load up on water. Bummer,\nthey don\u2019t have large gallon waters and it was expensive for bottle water. Premium item, eh? </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_152900_001.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_162604_023_01.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_162638_004_01.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We found a few things and went to purchase our items with the Visa\n(travel card!) and they don\u2019t take Visa. \nSay what? U.S. is contracted with\nVisa while Canada is contracted with Mastercard. Oh. \nAlright. We paid in U.S. cash and\nthey had to remember how to convert the currency. Yikes! \nSorry to hold up the line, folks!</p>\n\n<p>Yay, we gained our first Canadian currency of the trip! But, in an embarrassing manner.</p>\n\n<h2>Fueling Up</h2>\n\n<p>A little flustered from the currency exchange, we tried the gas station with the Visa.\u00a0 It took a couple tries at the pump, but I figured it out and we were able to purchase gas.\u00a0 Phew.\u00a0 Call home: \u201cYa, mom?\u00a0 We won\u2019t be coming home because we ran out of gas in Canada.\u00a0 So, we have to find work until we can fill up the tank lol.\u201d</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190508_1906570/\"><img src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_1906570.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><figcaption>Look, it's see-through!</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2>Crossing Big Bridges</h2>\n\n<p>Not wanting to be caught by surprise by a toll bridge, we\nresearched the route we needed to go to get to their downtown and found a\ntoll. Perfect. Alright! \nKatie: manned with the new Canadian currency coins and $5 bill. Chad: driving during the end of rush hour.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190508_191135/\"><img src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_191135.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure>\n\n<p>There were only a few lanes open for cash and we just happened to pull\ninto the ONLY one that didn\u2019t have an employee working at the booth. In the shuffle to get the coins, we bumped\ninto eachother in the car and one of the coins fell between the seats! WE needed a $1 to cross and I only had 3\nquarters\u2026..that could have been the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter we needed and now it\u2019d\nbeen eaten by the seats!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_191141_018.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_191141_027.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_191141_030.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We didn\u2019t have a dollar and needed to make change, so we tried to\nback up but there was already a 3-car line up behind us. Sweating. \nWe are slightly panicked, mostly embarrassed. Stupid Americans lol. The toll guy in the next booth had to get\nout, cross a lane and come to our booth\u2026then walk back to his booth, make\nchange and put the money in the slot for us\u2026.so embarrassing. Thanks.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_191148_012.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We tried to drive forward, but the road infront of us had red \u2018X\u2019\nabove two of the three lanes. The cars\nwere coming right at us! Or, so we\nthought. There was only one green lane\navailable and we started forward. It was\nthe weirdest bridge we have ever been on. \nThey can change the lane access based on the time of day to accommodate\ntraffic (hense the reason for the X\u2019s telling us which lanes we could drive in.</p>\n\n<h2>Parking, Please</h2>\n\n<p>Coming off the intense cortisol hit from the toll bridge, we\nstruggled a little finding parking and ended in a parking garage (Impark - $6\nfor the night). We went downtown to try\na seafood chowder and poutine! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_192309.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_192403.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_192458.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>First, we tried Salty\u2019s seafood chowder. Before we ordered dinner, we had the waiter\ncharge our card to make sure we would be able to pay for the meal. We did not want to be left high and dry\nagain! It worked and we tried their chowder. It was tasty, but not as good as the one we\nhad out in Seattle near their Pike\u2019s Market Place. Their cornbread was awesome, though.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190508_195312/\"><img src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_195312.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_192715.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_193759.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_194127.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Oh, Canada</h2>\n\n<blockquote><p>Yes, sing it. \"ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, CAAAAAAAAANNNADAAAAA\"</p></blockquote>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190508_195402/\"><img src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_195402.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_195436.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_195503.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_195520.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/3cqwUvi8\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Fries & Gravy</h2>\n\n<p>Next, we walked up the streets to find the poutine place. We were down in their historic downtown and\nthe old buildings were lit up and they had art everywhere. Music was blaring from their bars (live\nacoustic!) and there weren\u2019t that many people out at 9 p.m. (time shift again! Two hours a head of Minnesota).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_200219.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_2004130.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_200428.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_200513.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_200948.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Willy\u2019s poutine was a surprise. \nIt was good! The cheese curds\nwere yummy, the gravy flavorful and the pulled pork was smoked. YUM. A\nmedium order was MASSIVE and we walked to a bench to eat it (window service\nonly). We listened to a band and people\nwatched. We actually filled up and didn\u2019t\nhit the other food places we had intended to go to that night.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_201025.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_201319.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_2013460.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_201715.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_202035.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_202852.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190508_203201/\"><img src=\"/images/nova-scotia/20190508_203201.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure>\n\n<h2>Sleeping</h2>\n\n<p>Chad researched while I drove during the day and found a location\nfor sleeping: Wal-Mart. There is a\nsection where all of the campers park near Home Depot and it was right. There was about 5-6 and a semi resting when we\ngot there. </p>\n\n<p>Chad spotted a black blob with four legs walking around the\nparking lot and laughed. \u201cWhat if that\u2019s\na little black bear??\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Huh!!!??? That\u2019s not\ngood! But, it\u2019s shape transformed and we\nnoticed it looked more like a solid black wolf wandering around the parking lot! The wolf-dog went and curled up on the grass\naway from us and we settled in for bed. \nIt was supposed to get down to about 38 that night and we bundled up (I\nput on socks lol). It started to sprinkle rain and the black dog-blob\nvanished. Night Night to the wolf dog!</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 39: Halifax, Nova\nScotia was the turning point for our east coast road trip and we will start to\nhead home soon! Soon, as in, however\nlong it takes to drive ourselves back through the major Canadian cities and\naround the Great Lakes\u2026 </p>\n\n<h2>Wake Up Call</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Sleeping Space: Wal-Mart. Park on the Home Depot side with all of the other campers \u2013 it feels cozy.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now realizing the time zone changed epically to two hours ahead of Minnesota, we were awakened early in the morning (6 a.m. Minnesota, 8 a.m. Nova Scotia) by a landscaping crew unloading their gear to mow the grass right in front of our car. Ah! </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/peggys-cove/resized_20190509_062921.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Chad threw on a jacket, I threw all sleeping gear onto the back\nseat, and Chad drove us to the back of the lot no where near grass! We finished our morning routine of staring\nout the windows to wake up, cleaning and brushing teeth. The abrupt awakening always takes a little to\ncome down from.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/peggys-cove/screenshot_20190508-195055.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2>Chad\u2019s Check List</h2>\n\n<p>While driving into Halifax the day before, Chad researched their \u2018specialty\u2019\nfoods and mapped out our schedule to taste them all. Today\u2019s adventure included:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Two If By Sea (coffee)</li><li>King of Doniars</li></ul>\n\n<h2>Coffee \u2013 Check</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Parking: street parking \u2013 use Canadian coins, 2 hours</strong></p>\n\n<p>We officially woke up in the coffee shop with a beautiful looking croissant\nthing filled with strawberries and topped with chocolate. Yes, amazing. \nTheir drip coffee was delish with the pastry. At 11 a.m., the pizza place above the coffee\nshop opened and we were able to grab the very first slice of pizza! Very important, I know.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_095345.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_100438.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190509_095341/\"><img src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_095341.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_100921.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_101621.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_101604.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_073551.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Bridge Revenge </h2>\n\n<p>Splendidly happy with the morning\u2019s events with coffee, we trudged\nto the car knowing we would have to cross the toll bridge again (last night was\na little messy). Battle faces everyone! </p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190509_102344/\"><img src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_102344.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p>Chad drove. I prepped exact\nchange. We pulled up to the booth and\nChad tossed in the $1 coin into the bin (very carefully\u2026don\u2019t miss\u2026we aren\u2019t good\nat basketball\u2026). Green light, GO GO\nGO!!!! The lane access had changed from\nlast night and there were now two lanes we could choose from instead of just\none. Crazy! It\u2019s a cool way to control the flow of\ntraffic.</p>\n\n<h2>Different Gyros \u2013 Check</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Parking: street \u2013 no pay meters</strong></p>\n\n<p>Apparently, a Donair is like a gyro except it\u2019s been altered to have\nbeef, a completely new set of spices and a different white sauce. I guess they didn\u2019t like the original Greek\nversion. Chad found the most popular\nplace to grab this bite to eat - referenced as the Original Donair place. </p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190509_103546/\"><img src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_103546.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p>The guy behind the counter was super friendly, had a reallyyyyy\nthick Italian accent and said he wanted to take a picture with us \u2018Minnesotans\u2019. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_1039400.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_1039320.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_103816.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe drove across the country for this food!\u201d joked Chad, as we are finishing the East Coast Trip in this city.</p></blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_103828.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>The Italian guy started laughing and took our picture for us with\nour massive gyro.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Excited about the supreme gyro, Chad exclaimed \u201cit\u2019s like the size of a baby!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_104245.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_104434.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_104501.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chuckling, he wished us well. \nWe ate the sandwich in the restaurant and filled our bellies. It was a completely different flavor than the\nlamb gyros. The beef was spiced, still sliced\nthinly and topped with onions, tomatoes and their special white sauce. The sauce tasted like a sweet Italian dressing\nand it complimented the meat well. YUM.</p>\n\n<h2>Trip Diversion</h2>\n\n<p>While walking back to the car, we stopped inside a K-pop (South Korean pop music) and anime (Japanese animated characters) store for fun. We chatted with the college student working the shop and he happened to be from Chicago! </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_112121.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>He was studying there in Halifax and gave us some tips about places to go, including Peggy\u2019s Cove. He also talked about the legal weed in Canada and let us know where the best shops were. Thanks, but no thanks! But, learning about the Canadian policies on weed was fascinating since the U.S. is currently in a transition phase.</p>\n\n<h2>Peggy\u2019s Cove</h2>\n\n<p>Driving 45 minutes south to the ocean boarder, we stopped at Peggy\u2019s Cove to check out the large rocks. While on the drive out there, we watched the homes transition from city-feeling to being out-in-the-sticks buildings. This includes boat shacks, puddles of water your lawns (ponds), algae everywhere and siding that has seen better days (the salty air is a little harsh).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_1222320.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_122708.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_121454.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_122219.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p><strong>Parking: free at the visitors center within the town and at the top of the hill by the light house</strong></p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_125233.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_122812.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_124301.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_122714.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_122819.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The cove was a fun little stop because the rocks were super\nunique. Chad was a little bummed because\nnow we were another couple hours out of the way back to Maine, making the drive\nover 9 hours to our sleeping destination (it\u2019s like 1 p.m. lol\u2026\u2026). </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_124652.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_124512.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_124551.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_124822.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_124854.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The wind was cold, the water seemed cold (it\u2019s dangerous to touch\nthe ocean on these rocks because the waves/tides are unpredictable), and we\nwere cold. We played on the rocks,\ntouched the lighthouse and climbed back into the car.</p>\n\n<p>Hi-ho silver!

YUM, the team was awesome. Coffee was kinda generic coffee. There was a giant blueberry statue that we\ntook a selfie with from the within the car!</p>\n\n<p>Drive, drive, drive. We\ndrove all day and into the evening. At a\ngas station, I brought out the clementines, tried the smoked clams and waited\non the sardines. The clams were actually\nreally good!!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_155629.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_161019.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_161405.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_173537.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_164034.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_171242.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_155543.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Towards sunset, we drove by a town that claimed to have the World\u2019s\nLongest Covered Bridge. Why not see it\nquick? Turing off towards Hartland, New\nBrunswick we drove about 7 kilometers into the small town. </p>\n\n<p>The bridge was REALLY long and still used by the town \u2026\u2026 it\u2019s one\nway only\u2026.so we quickly got in line with cars that were crossing the same\ndirection as us. As soon as we were spit\nout on the other side, the waiting cars took their turn. Crazy!! \nLots of potential for a head-on collision. </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/friv5gaR\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_190834.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_200705-1.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_200645.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_200507.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/peggys-cove/20190509_1938570.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>More Banjos in the Woods</h2>\n\n<p>Thinking the highway road would pass through a few cute little\ntowns along the river, Chad routed us on an alternate route which happened to\ntake us into the back-country hills. It\nwas still on a highway, but it wasn\u2019t the main highway we had been traveling\nall day\u2026.. it was pitch black, there are moose and deer crossing signs\neverywhere and we had to travel slower to avoid potential suicidal animals. </p>\n\n<p>It took over 40 kilometers to get out of there, but it took over\nand hour because of the slower speed limit and the choice of not totally our\ncar on a massive moose going for a nightly stroll. </p>\n\n<p>Eventually, we crossed onto the real highway 103 and booked it to\nthe top of Maine for rest. Chad located\na Wal-Mart in a French mountain town only 30 minutes away from the Highway 1\nMile Marker in Maine. That is our\ndestination point for the East Coast! (we took a picture at highway 1 mile 0 in\nthe Florida Key\u2019s).</p>\n\n<p>Three other van campers were there with us and we rested well in\nthe cold air. Tomorrow, we will cross\nthe border back into the U.S. Hopefully,\nwe won\u2019t have any issues! </p>",

    "content": "<p>Dy 40: It only took us 40 days to reach our goal! We traveled from Minnesota, down through Texas, across the bottom of the U.S., and drove all the way down to the Florida Keys start at the end of Highway 1. Now, at the top of Highway 1 in Maine, we have completed our mission.</p>\n\n<h2>Riding the Border of Canada</h2>\n\n<p>The previous day, we traveled from Nova Scotia, through New Brunswick and rested about 30 minutes from the Mile Marker at a Wal-Mart in the province of Montreal. Montreal\u2019s official language is French, so like EVERYTHING is in French. It\u2019s cool, but we really don\u2019t know any basic words in French (Chad has some Spanish and I have some German). Smile and wave, ya\u2019ll!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_083506.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_090257.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_0831160.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>In the morning, we cleaned up at Wal-Mart (chilly night in the high 30s) and hit the road to travel through small towns along the river. The lifeline of the towns were the operations of the paper mills and lumber yards. The tard roads were so rutted up! I was actually scared we would pop a tire in a foreign country in which we can\u2019t communicate without a spare tire. Yes, this Jetta did not come with a spare, so we are free birding it!</p>\n\n<p>Chad\u2019s comment about potentially popping a tire and trying to communicate with the French-speaking natives of Montreal, \u201cwe just have to draw really pretty pictures and they will know what we are saying!\u201d</p>\n\n<h2>Crossing the U.S. Border</h2>\n\n<p>When we did arrive at the border, we crossed a bridge to the U.S. side and were then directed to the canopy \u201cwhere the officer will take care of you\u201d. Uh\u2026what?? So, Chad has a man bun and I have really curly red hair; we look like millennial hippies and they think we may have weed in the car (Canada has legal weed).</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190510_092935/\"><img src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_092935.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p>Chad parked the car, we left the keys on the front seat of the car (the officer joked saying no one was going to steal it here lol) and we were \u201cdetained\u201d inside the building while they searched our car. </p>\n\n<p>Following procedure for declaring items brought from Canada to the U.S. (veggies, animals, food, etc.), I mentioned we have clementines, a cucumber and an avocado with us. The officer sparked up and things got real.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190510_092811/\"><img src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_092811.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cCitrus foods cannot be brought into the U.S. and we will have to confiscate that item. How many do you have?\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Uhh\u2026 like 10 little orange circles? It turned out to be 19 and one of us had to claim it. I took the criminal act on my name.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t go on your record,\u201d said the officer. Oh, jeez. Thank goodness, I would hate to be a citrus criminal!!!</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>They literally took the bag of clemintines out of the cooler and threw them away in their breakroom garbage can. They said that it\u2019s been a thing for over 10 years now that citrus fruits cannot come across the border to help prevent a specific fruit fly from invading. Well, the more you know.</p>\n\n<h2>Photo Shoot Time</h2>\n\n<p>After the deal with border patrol, we literally drove the car no more than 200 feet from the station to the Mile Marker Memorial site lol. How lame did we feel. We sacrificed our 19 clementines for this! We were so sad, we needed a break.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190510_092932/\"><img src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_092932.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_092949.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_092949-1.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_092958.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Omelet Time</h2>\n\n<p>We parked across the street at a little dinner in the small town and ordered up two omelets. Chad had the Western (bell peppers, onions, mozzarella) and I had the steak and cheese omelet. Super tasty (Chad\u2019s was\u00a0the winner).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_094728.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_101417.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_101456.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Jitters now gone from the border crossing, we sighed and climbed back into the car to go BACK across the river to the Canadian side. Yes, we literally crossed the border to take a picture and eat food.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190510_094207_1/\"><img src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_094207_1.gif\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<h2>Canadian Border Crossing</h2>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190510_094030/\"><img src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_094030.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure>\n\n<p>The guy working the Canadian border crossing was really chill and let us go right across without a search. </p>\n\n<a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190510_101734/\"><img src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_101734.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n<p>We told him about the clementine snatch and he scoffed in a VERY French accent, \u201cwe could care less about\u00a0things like that.\u201d I asked if he would stamp my passport (I don\u2019t have a stamp yet and I\u2019ve been in Canada at least 4 times now!) and he said they normally don\u2019t do that anymore. But, he went to the back and stamped it for me!\u00a0\ud83d\ude0aTHANK YOU.</p>\n\n<p>On to the City of Quebec!!</p>\n\n<p>We drove and drive through some interesting country along the river dividing the U.S. and Canada. Follow up soon about adventures in Quebec City!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_111648.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_101727.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_111634.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_143140.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_111628.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/americas-first-mile/20190510_1116250.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>",

Chad's jacket has been worn so many times while hiking, the place where the backpack is held soaked through after about 2p minutes. I guess it was rubbed away? So, Chad was wet and my shoes were soaked (tennis shoes..meh).</p>\n\n<h2>Baklava </h2>\n\n<p>After a little while of checking out the streets, we ducked into a place with mountains of baklava ! They also made us a falafel gyro-thing. The flats bread was baked right there in an I with the falafel paste smeared on top. Wow. It was good. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/old-city-of-quebec/20190510_171539.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/old-city-of-quebec/20190510_171532.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/old-city-of-quebec/20190510_172325.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/old-city-of-quebec/20190510_171914.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Yes, we ate all of the baklava pieces .... they were yummy with the different kinds of nuts inside the pastry bread. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/old-city-of-quebec/20190510_164214.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/old-city-of-quebec/20190510_164141.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/old-city-of-quebec/20190510_164315.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/old-city-of-quebec/20190510_164547.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>To end the adventure, we stopped at a cafe to try their crepes.

    "content": "<p>Day 41: \u00a0Oh Canada, you are more than lumber jacks, maple syrup and hockey.\u00a0 You do have more to offer!\u00a0 </p>\n\n<h2>Get Rollin\u2019</h2>\n\n<p>Sleep happened in a Wal-Mart near Shawinigan, Quebec. Everything was French (the ads, signs,\nnewspapers, etc.) and we were a little worried. \nWhat if our GPS lady starts speaking instructions in French??? As soon as we talked about this, her next\ninstruction was basically in French because the street names are in French. She has a great accent!</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190511_090946/\"><img src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_090946.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><figcaption>They are serious about their red lights. Double trouble!</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2>Hello, Montreal Coffee</h2>\n\n<p>Montreal was a very different vibe than Old Quebec City. Their old buildings weren\u2019t like we drove\ninto a village and instead popped into a growing city. English used to be the primary language used\nfor government and schools, so the old government buildings we saw had English\nengravings.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_111155.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_111158.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI think Montreal has a really big coloring problem\u201d as we passed through the old industrial parts of Montreal hosting different kinds of graffiti on the buildings, \u201cthese poor kids don\u2019t get enough paper!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s get these people some crayons instead!</strong></p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_111203.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_111311.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad and I found a coffee shop called Crew Collective & Caf\u00e9,\nlocated inside a cathedral-like, old, 1920s bank. It was impressive walking up the large steps,\nthrough the golden encased door and under massive chandeliers. They also bragged about having really fast\nWiFi.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_111438.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_112044.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_112051.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We ordered two London fog teas, a croissant, and a lemon cake (sour! Chad loved it) from where the bank tellers used to conduct work. Now, baristas run the till and make espressos right on the counter. It\u2019s also <a href=\"https://www.mtlblog.com/best-of-mtl/10-of-the-most-instagrammable-coffee-shops-in-montreal\">one of the most Instagram-ed coffee shops in Montreal</a>.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_113023.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>(the sunlight wasn\u2019t the best and the pictures were super\nexposed! I tried lol This is where\nhaving a nice camera would be handy). </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_112102.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_125447.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_125527.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_130131.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Sad news: our laptops aren\u2019t \u2018advanced\u2019 enough with the right equipment\nto even pick up on the frequency for the REALLY fast internet. Our phones were able to detect it and I\nblogged on the Samsung. We are talking\nupload speeds like *snaps fingers*, like that fast. Wonderful!</p>\n\n<h2>Walking & Seeing</h2>\n\n<p>The afternoon was spent exploring a few of the streets and trying a couple macaroons (yes, we haven\u2019t had macaroons before!) at <a href=\"https://maisonchristianfaure.ca/en/\">Maison Christian Faure</a>.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_142844.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_143003.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_143246.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p> They were pretty good and didn\u2019t last long. It\u2019s kind of a bummer that they cost $3.50+ a piece\u2026\u2026\u2026 they\u2019re so tiny! Chad argued they come from a really big macaroon processing plant and are shipped all over the world in plastic containers. This could be a thing (making them not as authentic), but they still taste good haha.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_130528.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_130659.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_130729.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_132223.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_132656.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_132749.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>It's obvious we are tourists because we walk around pointing at everything... mainly, me. I point at everything. Control yourself, Katie haha. Chad also found an indoor mall with a large fountain.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_134858.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_135145.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_140754.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_150114.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_151945.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Bagel Run</h2>\n\n<p>Chad had located a bagel shop and we hopped back into the car to drive to the neighborhood. When we arrived, the streets were FLOODED with people. It was like being in people rush hour. Chad pulled into a residential parking spot, I hopped out and walked briskly to the bakery down the street.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_153044.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_153701.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_154411.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>There was a line at least 10 people deep and thankfully there was a sign for the menu with both English and French text. Cash only. Crap. I only had the card and we are saving the $5 bill in the car for unexpected tolls. In a hurry, I decided to skip the bagels until we could use our card or come across more Canadian currency. Better luck next time!</p>\n\n<p>The main street had stripped lanes and arrows above the ones we were allowed to drive in. They shift lanes based on the traffic time of day..... it was so confusing at first! (picture above).</p>\n\n<h2>Ottawa</h2>\n\n<p>We hopped back in the car and hit our second major city of the day: Ottawa. On Google Maps, there was a little red circle that said \u201cOttawa Flood\u201d. Uh??? Are we even able to go to the city? Not sure! We went anyway. Sights from the highway driving into Ottawa were filled with flooded farm fields! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_095311.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/screenshot_20190511-152504.png\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>I searched for buffets (we haven\u2019t had much to eat today \ud83d\ude09) and found <a href=\"https://tuckers.ca/\">Tucker\u2019s Marketplace</a>. It was super yummy! Large varieties of salads, seafood, hunks of meat and a hibachi bar for noodle dishes. Chad and I hit it. There was at least two rounds of people who filtered through their meals while we finished our long episode. Our favorite was the basil tortellini.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_181835.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_1834380.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_185508.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_185543.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_192022.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The waitress told us that across the river it was flooded and we\ncould see it if we went for a walk. \nDone. While walking over to the\nriver, we met some people that were from Toronto and they had also done a few\ncrazy road trip adventures through the States. \nSmall world! They even offered to take a picture of us. Thanks! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_194436.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_194508.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_194618.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_1946280.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_1947330.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_200619.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Chad caught up with his brother (Happy Birthday Matthew!) while\nlooking over the ledge at the swollen river. \nThere was also a man-made little canal that apparently freezes solid during\nthe winter and people ice skate to work, school, etc. Sounds super cool! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_202134.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_202541.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_202835.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_203020.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_203028.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_203340.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad wanted to help light up the picture for me since the natural light was fading....</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_2025180.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_202519.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_203609.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_204321.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_204332.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/montreal-ottawa-day-trip/20190511_210039.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Night Night</h2>\n\n<p>Full, happy and VERY tired, we drove about 45 minutes to a\nWal-Mart for rest. It was one of the\nnicest Wal-Marts we have slept at in Canada and we felt kinda uncomfortable\nlol. There were no car campers or\nRVs! So, we found a spot in the back and\nsettled in. </p>\n\n<p>Right when we were about to fall asleep, two SUVs pulled up literally\ntwo spaces away from us and joined the sleeping parade. But why so close!?! The occupants of both cars got out (maybe two\nor three people??), started to unload gear and worked in the semi-dark (parking\nlot lights were pretty decent) to set up a tent. They literally camped at Wal-Mart on the\ngrass next to the lot! It was a nice\nlittle green tent, but I appreciated the solid car more.</p>\n\n<p>No friendly Minnesota \u2018hello\u2019 was issued (restrain yourself lol)\nand we went to sleep. We were out like a\nlight with our full bellies.</p>",

Chad has been a hero driver and has basically driven this entire trip. </p>\n\n<p>We switch off sometimes, but usually our destinations are only 2-3 hours a part and Chad wants to \u201chear the sweet-nothingness of the keyboard typing\u201d to knock the blog out of the way for the previous day.

Chad was hard core out and was snoring a\nlittle.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"is-resized\"><a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190503_171852/\"><img src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190503_171852.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"427\" /></a><figcaption>Throw back to Martha's Vineyard</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p><strong>Snoring side-note:</strong> Chad doesn\u2019t snore \u2026. But halfway through the trip he started to snore. We are talking the soft purring kind of snore, but it can transition into really long pulls searching for air. Either way, I have woken up multiple times to poke him awake enough to stop the noise.</p>\n\n<p>We have found out after trials of pillow positions: Chad cannot\nhave his head propped up too high otherwise he will snore. There. \nProblem solved. Just sleep with a\nthinner pillow and everything will be alright!</p>\n\n<h2>Toronto</h2>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_113002.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_113007.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>With slightly drizzly weather, the Toronto skyline popped up with skyscrapers and an expansive infrastructure.\u00a0 I had planned out hitting a bakery for a bagel with lox, then stopping in for coffee to post the blog post at a caf\u00e9 and then we would drive the strip through the downtown space.\u00a0 Sigh, expectations are terrible when things don\u2019t work out they way you plan.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_113107.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_125532.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Bakery Fail</h2>\n\n<p>The bakery is probably really good and their desserts/loaves looked\ntasty, but I wanted to try their lox sandwich they had posted online for $3.50. I know! \nThat\u2019s wicked cheap for a lox bagel sandwich\u2026usually they are over $12.</p>\n\n<p>It was Mother\u2019s Day Sunday and the bakery shelves were almost cleared out by the time we arrived in the later afternoon. The tired older grandma running the show was a little crabby and there was no menu to look at. She built the sandwich on the still warm bagels (sesame and poppy seed) with lox, cucumbers and lettuce. No cream cheese? The price also jumped to about $8 a bagel sandwich\u2026.I think because of the fixings? </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_132722.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_133206.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_133726.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>So, maybe just stick to the baked goods at <a href=\"https://www.grodzinskibakery.com/\">Grodzinski\u2019s Bakery</a>. The chocolate brownie was fabulous. The lox sandwich made me appreciate the smoked salmon a lot more without the cream cheese. They had nice looking houses in the area, though.</p>\n\n<h2>Caf\u00e9 Fail</h2>\n\n<p>Next, it was blogging time. I found a cute caf\u00e9 that had umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and they also had WiFi, but when we arrived all of the seats with outlets were taken. The occupants wouldn\u2019t be moving anytime soon. Ugh. Maybe later <a href=\"http://hellodemello.net/\">De Mello Palheta Coffee Roasters</a>. And, Chad and I both had to really use the Washroom (Canadian, eh?). Thankfully, a few doors down was another caf\u00e9 and we were able to snag a space with power. They also had public washrooms! Ah, all better.</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://labohemecafe.ca/\">La Boheme Caf\u00e9 Patisserie </a></h2>\n\n<p>Chad and I hung out at the caf\u00e9 for a little bit recovering from our\nmorning adventure fails. We tried their ham\nand mozzarella quiche, drip coffee and the ginger-lemon tea. Upload speeds were awesome and we became\nhappy again once the caffeine kinda kicked in.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_141842.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_152959.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_153032.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_154824.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_154844.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Yonge Street</h2>\n\n<p>After the caf\u00e9, we drove their main strip all the way into downtown to a mini version of Times Square called \u2018\u2019<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonge%E2%80%93Dundas_Square\">Yonge-Dundas Square</a>\u201d. Around the corner was the large \u2018Toronto\u2019 sign in Nation Phillips Square where I wanted to get a picture. There are a few one ways there and we took a few wrong turns (Google Maps is a little slow with directions sometimes\u2026). </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_160340.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_160910.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_161507.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_161727.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_162634.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_163142.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Eventually, Chad was able to pull up to the Nathan\u2019s Square (illegally\nparked, kinda) while I hopped out, ran across the yard and took a picture of\ntheir little light of sign haha. Some\npeople also had the same idea as me, so I wasn\u2019t the only one.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_163319.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_163329.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_163845.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_163852.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_164557.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_164858.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_165526.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Canadian Costco Gas</h2>\n\n<p>Now about 4:15 p.m., we wanted to head out of town to get a jump\nstart towards Niagara Falls and to get some gas at Costco, but we took a few\nwrong turns again. We ended up at the\nharbor front by Lake Ontario and were stuck in traffic in their Entertainment\nDistrict for about 30 minutes because an event let out. We moved 3 miles. Ugh.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_171128_005.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>Ok, so maybe we can make it to Costco Gas before it closes at 5 p.m.\nCrawling by with congestion, we pulled into the pumps at 4:50 p.m. YES!!! We got up to the pumps, Chad hopped out and\nthen hopped back in after staring at the screen on the pump\u2026. WE FORGOT THAT\nCANADA COSTCO ONLY TAKES MASTERCARD. \nNOOOOOOOOOOO. We have Visa\u2026..</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_175232.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_1809540.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>So, we waited in traffic, took wrong turns, made it in time and\nstill lost lol. Great. Super happy campers, we found gas later up\nthe road and zoomed to our sleeping destination.</p>\n\n<h2>Recovery Food</h2>\n\n<p>Saving the day, we were able to find a really neat Yemen restaurant called the <a href=\"https://www.monasaba.ca/\">Yemen Cuisine Monasaba</a>. We tired the half chicken in rice and the steak stir-fry with a pita bread look alike. The food was really tasty, but the steak took the cake. It was a great ending to a funky day.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_185359.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_185440.jpg\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_185450.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_185747.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_190040.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/trial-errors-in-toronto/20190512_193635.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>There was also an extra order of bread that came out for someone,\nno one claimed it and the confused waiter didn\u2019t want to waste the bread. So, we\nwere served a second helping of bread! Thanks!\n</p>\n\n<h2>Rest is the Best</h2>\n\n<p>Chad drove into the night around the bend towards Niagara Falls\nand we camped at Wal-Mart near St. Catharines. \nI was half asleep and almost fell asleep on an unmade pillow fort. Chad was wide awake. We are total opposites sometimes. When one is up, the other is usually down\nhaha. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Lesson of the day: </strong> Expectations are bad. Let it flow and just be. Sigh. Yes, that is how it should be.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Day 43: Usually when Chad\nand I go see big landmarks, it\u2019s during the off-season. Spoiler alert: we didn\u2019t see the falls (at\nfirst). I was super disappointed, but after\na while the falls appeared and everything in the world was good again.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_084203.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_090740_001_01.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Hello, Good Morning</h2>\n\n<p>We had a few visitors at our Jetta this morning; good morning\ngeese! An excited Katie and a tired Chad\nreadied the car and we headed out to see Niagara Falls less than 30 minutes\naway.</p>\n\n<p>The Canadian side is full of tourist places (lots and lots of\nsigns everywhere), but mainly kid based.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I joked that, \u201cmaybe Niagara Falls is like the Vegas for small kids?\u00a0 They have flashy signs and fun things behind all of these doors!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_100126.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_100135.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_120234.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Chad had visited the Falls before and he found free parking up\nstream at a little nature reserve. It\nwas a two mile walk to the falls/Rainbow Bridge that connected Canada to the\nU.S.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Parking: Dufferin Islands Nature Area</strong></p>\n\n<p>Weather: drizzly, wet, cloudy, kinda chilly</p>\n\n<h2>Many Falls</h2>\n\n<p>While on the walk towards the Falls, we came across at least three\nlarge stone buildings that used to be functioning electrical companies using\nthe water to produce power. There was a\nlittle hump in the water (man-made) that was potentially still used for\nharnessing power. (I don\u2019t know, but it sounds cool). </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_104246.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_104309.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_104730.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_104754.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_104822.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_1051240.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>All this water rushing around made us both have to pee. Bad. We walked faster to the visitor\u2019s\ncenter. Go FASTER!!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_105734.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_105951.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_110358.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_110450.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_110451.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>There were a few little falls on the way to the massive drop, the\nwater was aggressive, mean and turbulent. Those rapids don\u2019t mess around. </p>\n\n<h2>Misty View</h2>\n\n<p>When we arrived at the main falls, we didn\u2019t even look at it and\nwe ducked hurriedly into the bathrooms. \nAhhh. [this would be a great place for a pun or joke about PSI or\ngallons per second compared to Niagara lol].</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://katherine-marie.com/20190513_111918/\"><img src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_111918.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><figcaption>Do you see?? There is Niagara Falls!</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Returning to the falls, it was covered by mist and we really\ncouldn\u2019t see it until about 30 minutes later while we continued to walk up the\nstrip. At the end, we decided not to\ncross over the bridge into the U.S. ($1 per person walking to cross and need ID\nfor U.S. border patrol) and stuck to Starbucks. \n</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_110532.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_111822.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_111930.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_112025.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_112232.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_112238.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_112914.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_113229.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_113400.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_113524.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_113853.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_113858.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Nature Walk</h2>\n\n<p>On the way back to the car, we walked their nature path while I\nwas jacked on caffeine. Talking 90-miles\nan hour and walking almost as fast, we arrived at the car in no time.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_114714.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_115836.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_120404.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_124436.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_124505.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_124533.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_124539.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_124640.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_124823.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_124941.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/bWibeZ8h\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Drive, Drive, Drive</h2>\n\n<p>Setting the GPS to Detroit, Michigan, we drove about 4 hours to\nsee the city. Before getting there, I\nresearched and found a little bakery that had cannolies.. YES! As we pulled off the interstate and drove\ninto town, there were flashing lights and sirens from three different police\ncars, one ambulance and two fire trucks. \nYes, angels? What are you trying\nto warn us about??</p>\n\n<p>We pulled into the bakery, stepped inside (famished having not had\nbreakfast) and they verified they are a cash only store. NO! \nUgh, I knew I should have called. \nWe were saving the $5 bill for tolls in Detroit and we weren\u2019t willing\nto hassle with the ATM to buy a $2 pastry. \nLame. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing\u2026..\nmaybe they were bad cannoli haha.</p>\n\n<h2>Detroit</h2>\n\n<p>I tried again. Detroit is\nknown for their special deep-dish pizza and Coney Hotdogs (maybe more, but\nthese are a little more interesting). Routed\nto get hotdogs in downtown Detroit, the map directed us to take the underground,\nunder-the-water tunnel to the U.S. Say,\nwhat?</p>\n\n<p>We crossed the border through Windsor, Canada and almost handed\nour passports to the toll guy. Lol. So,\nwe don\u2019t know what we are doing haha. \n$4.75 Canadian toll. See, it was\na good thing we didn\u2019t have cannoli. We\nneeded that $5 bill. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_1810510.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_181219.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_181225_009.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_181449.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The tunnel was pretty cool and Chad spotted a few wet spots on the\nwall. \u201cIt better not break, I don\u2019t\nthink you and I are that good of swimmers to beat the rushing water and hold\nour breath that long.\u201d </p>\n\n<h2>Hot Dog Rushin\u2019</h2>\n\n<p>We made it back into the U.S. with no issues!\u00a0 The boarder patrol guy was SUPER chill and told us he saw a brown bear in Virginia, Minnesota on his first day there for a job interview.\u00a0 Wow. On to hot dogs!\u00a0 After looping around the block and not seeing parking, Chad parked in the 15 minute parking and I hopped out to get two hot dogs. One from the original Coney hotdog restaurant 'American Coney Island' and another from the fall-out brother\u2019s restaurant 'Lafayette Coney Island'.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_182814.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_182906.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/rainy-niagara-falls/20190513_183232.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>We liked the one that tasted good.

But first, the Windy City visit we go.</p>\n\n<h2>Blossoms </h2>\n\n<p>SUPER groggy from last night\u2019s drive from Niagara Falls (12:30\na.m. arrival), we woke at 7:30 a.m. due to the bright sunlight beaming into the\ncar. It\u2019s like a little conservatory\nbecause Chad\u2019s feet smells [yes, totally bacteria or something] are multiplying\nto the point where we can sniff his boots (the culprit) from the closed trunk. It only happens when we walk. So all the\ntime.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/20190514_083359.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p><strong>Camping: Cracker Barrel, Merriville, Indiana</strong></p>\n\n<p>Soon we will be home! The\nview outside was pretty, though. </p>\n\n<h2>Chicago Destinations</h2>\n\n<p>I had reached out to our friend Glenn to ask about places to eat in Chicago as he used to roam and school there. He supplied a variety list of foods and we tried to complete the mission.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/glenn-chicago.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We were on the road by 8 a.m. and were stuck in semi traffic,\nmaking our 20-minute skip to the first destination take over an hour to get to\u2026\nYikes! We hopefully thought traffic\nwouldn\u2019t be as bad at Manhattan, NY (neither one of us has been to Chicago).</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/20190514_093859.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/20190514_102716.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/bXboKOiL?preloadContent=metadata\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Chinatown</h2>\n\n<p>This was a fun little space to be! \nWe scored $2 parking for 3 hours because we were going to visit a\nparticipating restaurant \ud83d\ude0a Hurray! (After we had spent about 20 minutes driving around\nfrustrated because they were attempting street cleaning and all the parking\nspaces were taken). The little town was\nclean, neatly set up and there were tons of people on the streets saying hello\nto each other. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/20190514_112050.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>We tried dim sum and a noodle beef dish at <a href=\"https://www.minghincuisine.com/\">MingHin Cuisine</a>.

There was a little embryo in it\u2026oh, I almost\nlost my dim sum because I felt the crunch under my shoe\u2026. Rest in pieces, my\nlittle friend.

They weren\u2019t a disappointment. Tucked between larger buildings, a little hotdog shack, named <a href=\"http://www.wienercircle.net/\">The Wiener\u2019s Circle</a>, was booming with customers and people honked at the shop while passing to wave high. Alight? So, this is a great place to be.</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/20190514_135313.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/20190514_135451.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/20190514_135607.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>While waiting for our dogs to be charred on the grill (real\nflames!), Chad snagged seating on the picnic benches outside while I chatted\nwith the locals inside. An older lady\ncalled me Minnesota and made me try her fries because \u201cthey are the best fries\nin Chicago\u201d. They were pretty good fries.\n She also made Chad try her fries too.\nLol \ud83d\ude09 </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/20190514_1359360.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/20190514_140027.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>I asked if I should put ketchup on the hotdogs and EVERYONE in the hotdog shack (behind the counter, at the grill and the waiting customers) all shouted, \u201cNOOO!\u201d I told them ketchup is a stable for Northerners and they all laughed. I skipped the ketchup. </p></blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/1qoE96l2?preloadContent=metadata\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>REALLY good hotdogs: char wiener, a pickle, relish, mustard, tomato,\npepper, onions (raw on one and saut\u00e9ed on the other) ALL hanging out together\nin a poppy seed bun. The bun was rockin\u2019\nbecause it didn\u2019t break the whole time. </p>\n\n<h2>Bye Chicago</h2>\n\n<p>Super full from our adventures, plus eating the left over Detroit\npizza from last night, we didn\u2019t have enough steam to dive into Chicago pizza\nor polish yummies. We will have to come\nback \ud83d\ude0a We did drive through a bunch of little main\nstreets in the suburbs of northern Chicago, our favorite was Boytown because it\nwas super colorful and full of plants. \nThe other strips were bland and commercial. Happy people make the place better! </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/20190514_143034_012.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/chicago-has-great-hot-dogs/20190514_143945.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Milwaukee</h2>\n\n<p>Only a few hours away, we spent the evening driving around the city and checking out the water front from highway over passes.

Oh yummy. \nMy favorite was the chicken dishes and the saag paneer. Chad kept packing it in and he especially\nloved the chicken&garlic dish. Oh,\nwe had a fun ride home in the car. First\nit was the feet smell, now it was the air quality. To be kind, I also contributed to the foul air\nvalue. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_134927.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_134931.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_134958.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_140451.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_143055.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_144507.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>I did ask Chad if he wanted me to drive home.\u00a0 He exclaimed, \u201chuh?\u00a0 Did you say, \u2018do we want us to die today\u2019?\u00a0 Even if the journey was safe, you have three blogs to write. Type type!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>THANKS! \ud83d\ude09 I\u2019ve maybe driven like three times this whole trip and Chad has\nsurvived the crazy east coast driving. \nGranted we were in Wisconsin (really chill driving environment), Chad\npreferred to not take any chances lol and I did really need to catch up on\nwords. </p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/Gm3N567l\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<blockquote><p>To take the highway west toward home, Chad reminded himself of the directions with a little saying, \u201cNever Eat Soggy Wheaties\u2026.we want Wheaties.\u201d And we proceeded onto I-94 West.\u00a0 Clever, isn\u2019t he?? (North.East.Sout.West \u2013 directions\u2026) \ud83d\ude0a </p></blockquote>\n\n<h2>Stopped Wisconsin Traffic</h2>\n\n<p>On the way home on I-94, we hung out with everyone on the highway\nfor about an hour due to some lovely humans repairing the freeway. We didn\u2019t talk to anyone, but we waved and\nshared the same feelings. It was a nice\nconnection. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_152411.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_170007.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_174724_014.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_184915.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>Oh, the fuel light came on and the car rapidly decided to eat the\nremaining gas we had. So, limping into\nthe gas station about 45 minutes later, we were finally safe. Culver\u2019s was across the street and I was able\nto publish a blog using McDonad\u2019s WiFi. It was worth the traffic wait. </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_180344.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_180553.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Ride Home</h2>\n\n<p>I-94 never seemed so long. \nThe journey home was going by quickly, but at the same time super\nslowly. There were mixed feelings of\nexcitement to be freed from the car but also a little sadness that the Great\n#EastCoastJetta road trip was ending (sadness on my part, Chad wanted to go\nhome since we finished New York ha \ud83d\ude09). </p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_185607_002.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_190641_001.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_193903_001.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_194212.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_194240.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_194300.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_211414.jpg\" /></figure></div></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_212613.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_212710.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_213141.jpg\" /></figure></div><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/h-o-g-s/20190515_213309.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>\n\n<p>The trip doesn\u2019t officially end until the next morning because we\nhave to clean everything. DEEPLY. So, I\u2019ll save the emotions and stats about\nthe trip for tomorrow.</p>",

AND! It was in Bloomington, Minnesota of all places!!</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/T7YgGkJh\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<p>We all enjoyed the escape to summer while hiding indoors at the water park! The breakfast buffet was super yummmmmy.</p>\n\n<div class=\"video-embed\"><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/aEM8mkfd\">Watch Video</a></div>\n\n<h2>Hopping into Reality</h2>\n\n<p>So, the car stinks like humans. And there is gear to clean, people to see, things to do and the chaos of hopping back into reality. Wow. It has been a wild few weeks back and so much has happened (also kinda stalled from writing because I was kinda annoyed by it! After writing for over 45 days, it gets to be a lot.)</p>\n\n<p>The Word Doc used to write the blog is at about 118 pages... so, congrats to all who followed along on the journey, you read a small book haha. </p>\n\n<p>We covered the interior with baking soda for a few days in the garage to absorb our stench and then gave Hall a good vacuuming. Soon we will break out the carpet cleaner and really get the stains out. Volkswagen fabric is not great with handling any kind of spills....even water leaves marks!</p>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/vacation-at-home/20190516_101935.jpg\" /><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/vacation-at-home/20190516_101950.jpg\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/vacation-at-home/20190517_151945.jpg\" /></figure></div></div></div></div>",
